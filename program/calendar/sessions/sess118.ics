SUMMARY:Paper session X: Performance Engineering in Filesystems
DESCRIPTION:CRUM: Checkpoint-Restart Support for CUDA's Unified Memory\n\n
 Garg, Mohan, Sullivan, Cooperman\n\nUnified Virtual Memory (UVM) was recen
 tly introduced with CUDA version 8 and the Pascal GPU. The older CUDA prog
 ramming style is akin to older large-memory UNIX applications which used t
 o directly load and unload memory segments. Newer CUDA programs have start
 ed taking advantage of UVM for the same ...\n\n---------------------\nGekk
 oFS - A temporary distributed file system for HPC applications\n\nVef, Mot
 i, Süß, Tocci, Nou...\n\nWe present GekkoFS, a temporary, highly-scalable 
 burst buffer file system which has been specifically optimized for new acc
 ess patterns of data-intensive High-Performance Computing (HPC) applicatio
 ns. The file system provides relaxed POSIX semantics, only offering featur
 es which are actually require...\n\n---------------------\nFixed-PSNR Loss
 y Compression for Scientific Data\n\nTao, Di, Liang, Chen, Cappello\n\nErr
 or-controlled lossy compression has been studied for years because of extr
 emely large volumes of data being produced by today’s scientific simulatio
 ns. None of existing lossy compressors, however, allow users to fix the pe
 ak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) during compression, although PSNR has been

  Scheduler for Shared Non-Volatile Burst Buffers\n\nKougkas, Devarajan, Su
 n, Lofstead\n\nModern HPC systems employ burst buffer installations to red
 uce the peak I/O requirements for external storage and deal with the burst
 iness of I/O in modern scientific applications.  These I/O buffering resou
 rces are shared between multiple applications that run concurrently. This 
 leads to severe per...\n
