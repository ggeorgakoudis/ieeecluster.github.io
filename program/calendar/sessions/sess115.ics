SUMMARY:Paper session VII: Benchmarking and Modeling
DESCRIPTION:Next Stop “NoOps": Enabling Cross-System Diagnostics Through G
 raph-based Composition of Logs and Metrics\n\nZasadziński, Solé, Bran
 don, Muntés-Mulero, Carrera\n\nPerforming diagnostics in IT systems is an 
 increasingly complicated task, and it is not doable in satisfactory time b
 y even most skillful operators. Systems and their architecture change very
  rapidly in response to business and user demand. Many organizations see v
 alue in the maintenance and managem...\n\n---------------------\nA Methodo
 logy for Characterizing the Correspondence Between Real and Proxy Applicat
 ions\n\nAaziz, Cook, Cook, Juedeman, Richards...\n\nProxy applications are
  a simplified means for stakeholders to evaluate how both hardware and sof
 tware stacks might perform on the class of real applications that they are
  meant to model. However, characterizing the re- lationship between them a
 nd their behavior is not an easy task. We present a data...\n\n-----------
 ----------\nLightweight Requirements Engineering for Exascale Co-design\n\
 nCalotoiu, Graf, Hoefler, Lorenz, Wolf\n\nGiven the tremendous cost of an 
 exascale system, its architecture\n  must match the requirements of the ap
 plications it is supposed to\n  run as precisely as possible. Conversely, 
 applications must be\n  designed such that building an appropriate system 
 becomes feasible,\n  motivating the idea of co-des...\n
