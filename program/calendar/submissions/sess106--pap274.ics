SUMMARY:The Tofu Interconnect D
DESCRIPTION:The Tofu Interconnect D\n\nAjima, Kawashima, Okamoto...\n\n\nI
 n this paper, we introduce a new and highly scalable interconnect called T
 ofu interconnect D that will be used in the post-K machine. This machine w
 ill officially be operational around 2021. The letter D represents high “d
 ensity” node and “dynamic” packet slicing for “dual-rail” transfer. Herein
  we describe the design and the evaluation results of TofuD. Due to the hi
 gh-density packaging, the optical link ratio of TofuD has decreased to 25%
  from the 66% optical link ratio of Tofu2. TofuD applies a new technique c
 alled dynamic packet slicing to reduce latency and to improve fault resili
 ence. The evaluation results show that the one-way 8-byte Put latency is 0
 .49 μs. This is 31% lower than the latency of Tofu2. The injection ra
 te per node is 38.1 GB/s which is approximately 83% of the injection rate 
 of Tofu2. The link efficiency is as high as approximately 93%.
