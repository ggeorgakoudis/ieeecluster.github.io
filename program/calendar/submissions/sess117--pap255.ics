SUMMARY:Computing Exact Vertex Eccentricity on Massive-scale Distributed G
 raphs
DESCRIPTION:Computing Exact Vertex Eccentricity on Massive-scale Distribut
 ed Graphs\n\nIwabuchi, Sanders, Henderson...\n\n\nThe eccentricity of a ve
 rtex is defined as the length of the longest shortest path to any other ve
 rtex. While eccentricity is an important measure of vertex centrality, dir
 ectly computing exact eccentricity for all vertices on large-scale graphs 
 is prohibitively costly. Takes and Kosters proposed an iterative algorithm
  that uses multiple runs of single-source shortest path (SSSP) to compute 
 lower and upper bounds on eccentricity at every vertex. Their technique co
 nverges to exact eccentricity by performing SSSP from only a small percent
 age of vertices, when sources are efficiently selected. However, their sou
 rce selection strategies do not always yield rapid convergence.\n\nWe prop
 ose a pincer movement source selection algorithm that efficiently selects 
 source vertices based on analysis of the lower and upper bounds produced b
 y SSSP. We also leverage k-BFS, which runs breadth-first search (BFS) from
  multiple sources concurrently on HavoqGT, a high-performance vertex-centr
 ic message-passing graph processing framework, to achieve an additional si
 gnificant performance improvement on distributed-memory systems.\n\nWe dem
 onstrate that our novel source vertex selection strategy has better perfor
 mance on\nvarious real-world graph datasets compared with the previous str
 ategy. In addition, we compute exact eccentricity for graphs with more tha
 n 1000X more edges (112B undirected edges) than graphs in the previous lit
 erature.
