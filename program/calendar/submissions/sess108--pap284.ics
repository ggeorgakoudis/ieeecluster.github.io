SUMMARY:UniviStor: Integrated Hierarchical and Distributed Storage for HPC
DESCRIPTION:UniviStor: Integrated Hierarchical and Distributed Storage for
  HPC\n\nWang, Byna, Dong...\n\n\nHigh performance computing (HPC) architec
 tures have been adding new layers of storage, such as burst buffers to tol
 erate latency between memory and disk-based file systems.\nHowever, existi
 ng file system and burst buffer solutions typically manage each storage la
 yer individually. Consequently, the burden of managing data across multipl
 e layers falls upon HPC system users. \n\nTo hide the complexity of managi
 ng the scattered storage devices from applications, we introduce \textit{U
 niviStor}, a novel system offering a unified view of  storage layers. By c
 onsidering each layer's distinct characteristics, UniviStor provides perfo
 rmance optimization algorithms and data structures for distributed and hie
 rarchical data placement, interference-aware data movement scheduling, ada
 ptive data striping, and lightweight workflow management. UniviStor suppor
 ts parallel I/O libraries, such as MPI-IO and HDF5. Our evaluations on a l
 arge-scale supercomputer demonstrated that UniviStor outperforms Data Elev
 ator, a state-of-the-art transparent caching solution for burst buffers by
  up to 17x and Lustre by up to 46x
