SUMMARY:SciDP: Support HPC and Big Data Applications via Integrated Scient
 ific Data Processing
DESCRIPTION:SciDP: Support HPC and Big Data Applications via Integrated Sc
 ientific Data Processing\n\nFeng, Sun, Yang...\n\n\nModern High Performanc
 e Computing (HPC) applications, such as Earth science simulations, produce
  large amounts of data due to the surging of computing power, while big da
 ta applications have become more compute-intensive due to increasingly sop
 histicated analysis algorithms. The needs of both HPC and big data technol
 ogies for advanced HPC and big data applications create a demand for integ
 rated system support. In this study, we introduce Scientific Data Processi
 ng (SciDP) to support both HPC and big data applications via integrated sc
 ientific data processing. SciDP can directly process scientific data store
 d on a Parallel File System (PFS), which is typically deployed in an HPC e
 nvironment, in a big data programming environment running atop Hadoop Dist
 ributed File System (HDFS). SciDP seamlessly integrates PFS, HDFS, and the
  widely-used R data analysis system to support highly efficient processing
  of scientific data. It utilizes the merits of both PFS and HDFS for fast 
 data transfer, overlaps computing with data accessing, and integrates R in
 to the data transfer process. Experimental results show that SciDP acceler
 ates analysis and visualization of a production NASA Center for Climate Si
 mulation (NCCS) climate and weather application by 6x to 8x when compared 
 to existing solutions.
