      <p>
        The collection of the final (camera-ready) papers as well as the necessary copyright forms is handled by Conference Publishing Services (CPS) of the IEEE Computer Society.
        Authors of accepted conference and workshop papers will receive the link to the CPS Online Author Kit and Submission platform with their paper acceptance email.
        For submitting your final paper, you need to create an account for this platform, sign in, and then follow the online instructions.
        The platform provides all necessary information, files, templates, and guides you through the necessary steps to submit your paper.
        These include uploading of the final paper according to the <a href="https://www.computer.org/cms/CPS/app/8x11-2/instruct8.5x11x2.pdf">IEEE Xplore formatting instructions</a> and paper validation (plagiarism/format check) via IEEE PDF eXpress.
