SUMMARY:AI for Science (Alok N. Choudhary)
DESCRIPTION:Keynote\n\nAI for Science (Alok N. Choudhary)\n\nChoudhary\n\n
 "AI for Science" seeks to understand, explore and develop Machine Learning
  and Data Mining approaches for accelerating scientific discoveries as wel
 l as designs. An example of this is learning from data to build predictive
  models that can enable exploration of scientific questions without relyin
 g upon underlying theory. Given that modern instruments, supercomputing si
 mulations, experiments, sensors and IoT are creating massive amounts of da
 ta at an astonishing speed and diversity, AI for Science has the potential
  to accelerate science discoveries by orders of magnitude. Another example
  is the acceleration of so called the "inverse problems" which explore the
  design space based on desired properties. This talk presents examples, po
 ssibilities and limitations of "AI for Science".
