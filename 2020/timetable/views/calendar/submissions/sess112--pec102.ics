SUMMARY:The Price Performance of Performance Models (Felix Wolf)
DESCRIPTION:Keynote\n\nThe Price Performance of Performance Models (Felix 
 Wolf)\n\nWolf\n\nTo understand the scaling behavior of HPC applications, d
 evelopers often use performance models. A performance model is a formula t
 hat expresses a key performance metric, such as runtime, as a function of 
 one or more execution parameters, such as core count and input size. Perfo
 rmance models offer quick insights on a very high level of abstraction, in
 cluding predictions of future behavior. In view of the complexity of today
 â€™s applications, which often combine several sophisticated algorithms, cre
 ating performance models manually is extremely laborious. Empirical perfor
 mance modeling, the process of learning such models from performance data,
  offers a convenient alternative, but comes with its own set of challenges
 . The two most prominent ones are noise and the cost of the experiments ne
 eded to generate the underlying data. In this talk, we will review the sta
 te of the art in empirical performance modeling and investigate how we can
  employ machine learning and other strategies to improve the quality and l
 ower the cost of the resulting models.
