SUMMARY:Opportunities and limitations of Quality-of-Service in Message Pas
 sing applications on adaptively routed Dragonfly and Fat Tree networks
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nOpportunities and limitations of Quality-of-Service i
 n Message Passing applications on adaptively routed Dragonfly and Fat Tree
  networks\n\nWilke, Kenny\n\nAvoiding communication bottlenecks remains a 
 critical challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) as systems grow to 
 exascale. Numerous design possibilities exist for avoiding network congest
 ion including topology, adaptive routing, congestion control, and quality-
 of-service (QoS). While network design often focuses on topological featur
 es like diameter, bisection bandwidth, and routing, efficient QoS implemen
 tations will be critical for next-generation interconnects. HPC workloads 
 are dominated by tightly-coupled mathematics, making delays in a single me
 ssage manifest as delays across an entire parallel job. QoS can spread tra
 ffic onto different virtual lanes (VLs), lowering the impact of network ho
 tspots by providing priorities or bandwidth guarantees that prevent starva
 tion of critical traffic. Two leading topology candidates, Dragonfly and F
 at Tree, are often discussed in terms of routing properties and cost, but 
 the topology can have a major impact on QoS. While Dragonfly has attractiv
 e routing flexibility and cost relative to Fat Tree, the extra routing com
 plexity requires several VLs to avoid deadlock. Here we discuss the specia
 l challenges of Dragonfly, proposing configurations that use different rou
 ting algorithms for different service levels (SLs) to limit VL requirement
 s. We provide simulated results showing how each QoS strategy performs on 
 different classes of application and different workload mixes. Despite Dra
 gonfly's desirable characteristics for adaptive routing, Fat Tree is shown
  to be an attractive option when QoS is considered.
