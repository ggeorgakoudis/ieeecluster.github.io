SUMMARY:HCL: Distributing Parallel Data Structures in Extreme Scales
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nHCL: Distributing Parallel Data Structures in Extreme
  Scales\n\nDevarajan, Kougkas, Bateman, Sun\n\nMost parallel programs use 
 irregular control flow and data structures, which are perfect for one-side
 d communication paradigms such as MPI or PGAS programming languages. Howev
 er, these environments lack the presence of efficient function-based appli
 cation libraries that can utilize popular communication fabrics such as TC
 P, IB, and RoCE. Additionally, there is a lack of high-performance data st
 ructure interfaces. We present Hermes Container Library (HCL), a high-perf
 ormance distributed data structures library that offers high-level abstrac
 tions including hash-maps, sets, and queues. HCL uses a RPC over RDMA tech
 nology that implements a novel functional programming paradigm. In this pa
 per, we present the HCL DataBox abstraction that enables fast data seriali
 zation of complex data types, data persistency on flash storage, and inter
 - and intra-node data access optimization via a hybrid data access model. 
 Evaluation results from testing the performance of a set of HCL data struc
 tures shows that HCL programs are 2x to 12x faster compared to BCL, a stat
 e-of-the-art distributed data structure library.
