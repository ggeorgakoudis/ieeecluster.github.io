SUMMARY:ECS2: A Fast Erasure Coding Library for GPU-Accelerated Storage Sy
 stems With Parallel & Direct IO
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nECS2: A Fast Erasure Coding Library for GPU-Accelerat
 ed Storage Systems With Parallel & Direct IO\n\nChang, Chou, Chou, Chung\n
 \nAs data volume keeps increasing in a rapid rate, there is an urgent need
  for large, reliable and cost-effective storage systems. Erasure coding ha
 s drawn increasing attention because of its ability to ensure data reliabi
 lity with higher storage efficiency, and it has been widely adopted in man
 y distributed and large-scale storage systems, such as Azure cloud storage
  and HDFS. However, the storage efficiency of erasure code comes at the pr
 ice of higher computing complexity. While many studies have shown the codi
 ng computations can be significantly accelerated using GPU, the overhead o
 f data transfer between storage devices and GPUs become a new performance 
 bottleneck. In this work, we designed and implemented, ECS2, a fast erasur
 e coding library on GPU-accelerated storage to let users enhance their dat
 a protection with transparent IO performance and file system like programm
 ing interface. By taking advantage of the latest GPUDirect technology supp
 orted on Nvidia GPU, our library is able to bypass CPU and host memory cop
 y from the IO path, so that both the computing and IO overhead from coding
  can be minimized. Using synthetic IO workload based on real storage syste
 m trace, we show that the IO latency can be reduced by 10%~20% with GPUDir
 ect technology, and the overall IO throughput of a storage system can be i
 mproved up to 70%.
