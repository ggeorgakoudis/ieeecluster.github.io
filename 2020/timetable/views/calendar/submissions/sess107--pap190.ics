SUMMARY:A Staging Based Task Execution Framework for Data-driven Scientifi
 c Workflows
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nA Staging Based Task Execution Framework for Data-dri
 ven Scientific Workflows\n\nWang, Subedi, Dorier, Davis, Parashar\n\nAs sc
 ientific workflows increasingly use extreme-scale resources, the imbalance
  between higher computational capabilities, generated data volumes, and av
 ailable I/O bandwidth is limiting the ability to translate these scales in
 to insights. In-situ workflows (and the in-situ approach) are leveraging s
 torage levels close to the computation in novel ways in order to reduce th
 e required I/O. However, to be effective, it is important that the mapping
  and execution of such in-situ workflows adopts a data-driven approach, en
 abling in-situ tasks to be executed flexibly based upon data content. This
  paper first explores the design space for data-driven in-situ workflows. 
 Specifically, it presents a model that captures different factors that inf
 luence the mapping, execution, and performance of data-driven in-situ work
 flows and experimentally studies the impact of different mapping decisions
  and execution patterns. The paper then presents the design, implementatio
 n, and experimental evaluation of a data-driven in-situ workflow execution
  framework that leverages in-memory distributed data management and user-d
 efined task-triggers to enable efficient and scalable in-situ workflow exe
 cution.
