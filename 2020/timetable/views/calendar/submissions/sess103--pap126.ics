SUMMARY:Resilient Scheduling of Moldable Jobs on Failure-Prone Platforms
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nResilient Scheduling of Moldable Jobs on Failure-Pron
 e Platforms\n\nBenoit, Le FÃ¨vre, Perotin, Raghavan, Robert...\n\nThis pape
 r focuses on the resilient scheduling of moldable parallel jobs on high-pe
 rformance computing (HPC) platforms. Moldable jobs allow for choosing a pr
 ocessor allocation before execution, and their execution time obeys variou
 s speedup models. The objective is to minimize the overall completion time
  of the jobs, or makespan, assuming that jobs are subject to arbitrary fai
 lure scenarios, and hence need to be re-executed each time they fail until
  successful completion. This work generalizes the classical framework wher
 e jobs are known offline and do not fail. We introduce a list-based algori
 thm, and prove new %complexity results and\napproximation ratios for three
  prominent speedup models (roofline, communication, Amdahl). We also intro
 duce a batch-based algorithm, where each job is allowed a restricted numbe
 r of failures per batch, and prove a new approximation ratio for the arbit
 rary speedup model. We conduct an extensive set of simulations to evaluate
  and compare different variants of the two algorithms. The results show th
 at they consistently outperform some baseline heuristics. In particular, t
 he list algorithm performs better for the roofline and communication model
 s, while the batch algorithm has better performance for the Amdahl's model
 . Overall, our best algorithm is within a factor of 1.47 of a lower bound 
 on average over the whole set of experiments, and within a factor of 1.8 i
 n the worst case.
