SUMMARY:Fugaku: the First `Exascale' Supercomputer (Satoshi Matsuoka)
DESCRIPTION:Keynote\n\nFugaku: the First `Exascale' Supercomputer (Satoshi
  Matsuoka)\n\nMatsuoka\n\nFugaku is the first `exascale’ supercomputer of 
 the world, not due to its peak double precision flops, but rather, its dem
 onstrated performance in real applications that were expected of exascale 
 machines on their conceptions 10 years ago, as well as reaching actual exa
 flops in new breed of benchmarks such as HPL-AI. But the importance of Fug
 aku is "applications first" philosophy under which it was developed, and i
 ts resulting mission to be the centerpiece for rapid realization of the so
 -called Japanese `Society 5.0' as defined by the Japanese S&T national pol
 icy. As such, Fugaku’s immense power is directly applicable not only to tr
 aditional scientific simulation applications, but can be a target of Socie
 ty 5.0 applications that encompasses conversion of HPC & AI & Big Data as 
 well as Cyber (IDC & Network) vs. Physical (IoT) space, with immediate soc
 ietal impact. In fact, Fugaku is already in partial operation a year ahead
  of schedule, primarily to obtain early Society 5.0 results including comb
 atting COVID-19 as well as resolving other important societal issues.
