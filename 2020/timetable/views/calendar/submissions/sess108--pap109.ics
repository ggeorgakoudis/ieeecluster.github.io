SUMMARY:Exploring Non-Volatility of Non-Volatile Memory for High Performan
 ce Computing Under Failures
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nExploring Non-Volatility of Non-Volatile Memory for H
 igh Performance Computing Under Failures\n\nRen, Wu, Li\n\nHardware failur
 es and faults often result in application crash in HPC. The emergence of n
 on-volatile memory (NVM) provides a solution to address this problem. Leve
 raging the non-volatility of NVM, one can build in-memory checkpoints or e
 nable crash-consistent data objects. However, these solutions cause large 
 memory consumption, extra writes to NVM, or disruptive changes to applicat
 ions. We introduces a fundamentally new methodology to handle HPC under fa
 ilures based on NVM. In particular, we attempt to use remaining data objec
 ts in NVM (possibly stale ones because of losing data updates in caches) t
 o restart crashed applications. To address the challenge of possibly unsuc
 cessful recomputation after the application restarts, we introduce a frame
 work EasyCrash that uses a systematic approach to automatically decide how
  to selectively persist application data objects to significantly increase
  possibility of successful recomputation. EasyCrash enables up to 30\% imp
 rovement (20\% on average) in system efficiency at various system scales.
