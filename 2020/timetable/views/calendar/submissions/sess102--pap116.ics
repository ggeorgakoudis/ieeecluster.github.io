SUMMARY:DelveFS - An event-driven semantic file system for object stores
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nDelveFS - An event-driven semantic file system for ob
 ject stores\n\nVef, Steiner, Salkhordeh, Steinkamp, Vennetier...\n\nData-d
 riven applications are becoming increasingly important in numerous industr
 ial and scientific fields, growing the need for scalable data storage, suc
 h as object storage.\nYet, many data-driven applications cannot use object
  interfaces directly and often have to rely on third-party file system con
 nectors that support only a basic representation of objects as files in a 
 flat namespace.\nWith sometimes millions of objects per bucket, this simpl
 e organization is insufficient for users and applications who are usually 
 only interested in a small subset of objects.\nThese huge buckets are not 
 only lacking basic semantic properties and structure, but they are also ch
 allenging to manage from a technical perspective as object store file syst
 ems cannot cope with such directory sizes. \n\n\nDelveFS is the first obje
 ct store file system that solves this challenge by offering the ability to
  compose a custom semantic file system that allows multiple unique views o
 nto the object store.\nThrough flexible filters, users can specify each vi
 ew's content, tailored to their unique interests or an application's requi
 rements.\nBy processing object store events which describe changes in the 
 object store, DelveFS is able to keep all views eventually consistent. \nD
 elveFS allows to operate concurrently through the object and file system i
 nterfaces on the same set of objects, delivering similar file system throu
 ghput compared to the native object store interfaces or other file system 
 connectors.
