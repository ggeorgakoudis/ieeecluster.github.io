SUMMARY:Quantifying the impact of network congestion on application perfor
 mance and network metrics
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nQuantifying the impact of network congestion on appli
 cation performance and network metrics\n\nZhang, Groves, Cook, Wright, Cos
 kun\n\nIn modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems, network congest
 ion is an important factor that contributes to performance degradation. Ho
 wever, how network congestion impacts application performance is not fully
  understood. As Aries network, a recent HPC network architecture featuring
  a dragonfly topology, is equipped with network counters measuring packet 
 transmission statistics on each router, these network metrics can potentia
 lly be utilized to understand network performance. In this work, by experi
 ments on a large HPC system, we quantify the impact of network congestion 
 on various applications' performance in terms of execution time, and we co
 rrelate application performance with network metrics. Our results demonstr
 ate diverse impacts of network congestion: while applications with intensi
 ve MPI operations (such as HACC and MILC) suffer from more than 40% extens
 ion in their execution times under network congestion, applications with l
 ess intensive MPI operations (such as Graph500 and HPCG) are mostly not af
 fected. We also demonstrate that a stall-to-flit ratio metric derived from
  Aries network counters is positively correlated with performance degradat
 ion and, thus, this metric can serve as an indicator of network congestion
  in HPC systems.
