SUMMARY:Towards End-to-end SDC Detection for HPC Applications Equipped wit
 h Lossy Compression
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nTowards End-to-end SDC Detection for HPC Applications
  Equipped with Lossy Compression\n\nLi, Di, Zhao, Liang, Chen...\n\nData r
 eduction techniques have been widely demanded and used by large-scale high
  performance computing (HPC) applications because of vast volumes of data 
 to be produced and stored for post-analysis. Due to very limited compressi
 on ratios of lossless compressors, error-bounded lossy compression has bec
 ome an indispensable part in many HPC applications nowadays, because it ca
 n significantly reduce science data volume with user-acceptable data disto
 rtion. Since the large- scale HPC applications equipped with lossy compres
 sion techniques always need to deal with vast volume of data, soft errors 
 or silent data corruptions (SDC) are non-negligible. Although SDC detectio
 n techniques have been studied for years, no studies were performed toward
  the HPC applications with lossy compression, leaving a significant gap be
 tween these applications and confidence of execution results. To fill this
  gap, this paper proposes a couple of SDC detection strategies for scienti
 fic simulations with lossy compression. Experimental results on 4 widely u
 sed scientific simulation datasets show promising detection ability could 
 be still obtained with two popular lossy compressors. Our parallel experim
 ents with up to 1,024 cores confirm that the time overheads could be limit
 ed within 7.9%.
