SUMMARY:Efficient Process-to-Node Mapping Algorithms for Stencil Computati
 ons
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nEfficient Process-to-Node Mapping Algorithms for Sten
 cil Computations\n\nvon Kirchbach, Lehr, Hunold, Schulz, Tr√§ff\n\nGood pro
 cess-to-compute-node mappings can be decisive\nfor well performing HPC app
 lications. A special, important\nclass of process-to-node mapping problems
  is the problem of\nmapping processes that communicate in a sparse stencil
  pattern\nto Cartesian grids. By thoroughly exploiting the inherently\npre
 sent structure in this type of problem, we devise three novel\ndistributed
  algorithms that are able to handle arbitrary stencil\ncommunication patte
 rns effectively. We analyze the expected\nperformance of our algorithms ba
 sed on an abstract model of\ninter- and intra-node communication. An exten
 sive experimental\nevaluation on several HPC machines shows that our algor
 ithms\nare up to two orders of magnitude faster in running time\nthan a (s
 equential) high-quality general graph mapping tool,\nwhile obtaining simil
 ar results in communication performance.\nFurthermore, our algorithms also
  achieve significantly better\nmapping quality compared to previous state-
 of-the-art Cartesian\ngrid mapping algorithms. This results in up to a thr
 eefold\nperformance improvement of an MPI_Neighbor_alltoall\nexchange oper
 ation. Our new algorithms can be used to implement\nthe MPI_Cart_create fu
 nctionality.
