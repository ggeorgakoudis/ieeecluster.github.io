SUMMARY:Power Budgeting of Big Data Applications in Container-based Cluste
 rs
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nPower Budgeting of Big Data Applications in Container
 -based Clusters\n\nEnes, Fieni, Expósito, Rouvoy, Touriño\n\nEnergy consum
 ption is currently highly regarded on computing systems for many reasons, 
 such as improving the environmental impact and reducing operational costs 
 considering the rising price of energy. Previous works have analysed how t
 o improve energy efficiency from the entire infrastructure down to individ
 ual computing instances (e.g., virtual machines). However, the research is
  more scarce when it comes to controlling energy consumption, specially in
  real time and at the software level. This paper presents a platform that 
 manages a power budget to cap the energy along several hierarchies, from u
 sers to applications and down to individual computing instances. Using sof
 tware containers as the underlying virtualization technology, the energy l
 imitation is implemented thanks to the platform’s ability to monitor conta
 iner energy consumption and dynamically adjust its CPU resources via verti
 cal scaling as required. Several representative Big Data applications have
  been deployed on the proposed platform to prove the feasibility of this p
 ower budgeting approach for energy control, showing that it is possible to
  effectively distribute and enforce a power budget among several users and
  applications.
