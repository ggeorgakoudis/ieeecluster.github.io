SUMMARY:Analysis of Cooling Water Temperature Impact on Computing Performa
 nce and Energy Consumption
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nAnalysis of Cooling Water Temperature Impact on Compu
 ting Performance and Energy Consumption\n\nNonaka, Hanawa, Shoji\n\nThe ho
 t water cooling technique has been widely accepted as one of the standard 
 techniques to improve the energy efficiency for the HPC and Data Centers. 
 However, the higher operating temperature may impact the CPU power consump
 tion due to the leakage current. Moreover, it may degrade the computationa
 l performance due to the DVFS mechanism activated to maintain the power an
 d temperature within the TDP limit. In that sense, to fairly evaluate the 
 efficiency of the hot water cooling technique, it becomes important to tak
 e into consideration not only the energy reduction on the HPC facility sid
 e (cooling system) but also the impact on the power consumption and the pe
 rformance degradation on the HPC system side. In this paper, we utilized t
 he Oakforest-PACS system and its facility, jointly administrated by Univer
 sity of Tsukuba and The University of Tokyo, in order to execute a quantit
 ative and systematic analysis on the impact of the cooling water temperatu
 re onto the HPC system and its facility. For this purpose, we utilized low
 er (9oC) and higher (18oC) cooling water temperature other than the regula
 r operational temperature (12oC). Contrary to the gain in the energy consu
 mption, on the HPC facility side, when using higher cooling water temperat
 ure, we observed an increase in the number of nodes suffering from perform
 ance degradation on the HPC system side. As a result, it can directly incr
 ease the probability of including low-performance nodes on multiple node j
 obs, and thus affecting their overall performance, especially during barri
 er synchronizations.
