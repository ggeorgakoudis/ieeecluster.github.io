SUMMARY:T1: Best Papers
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nHAN: a Hierarchical AutotuNed Collective Communicatio
 n Framework\n\nLuo, Wu, Bosilca, Pei, Cao...\n\nHigh-performance computing
  (HPC) systems keep growing in scale and heterogeneity to satisfy the incr
 easing computational need, and this brings new challenges to the design of
  MPI libraries, especially with regard to collective operations.\n\nTo add
 ress these challenges, we present "HAN," a new hierarc...\n\n-------------
 --------\nDelveFS - An event-driven semantic file system for object stores
 \n\nVef, Steiner, Salkhordeh, Steinkamp, Vennetier...\n\nData-driven appli
 cations are becoming increasingly important in numerous industrial and sci
 entific fields, growing the need for scalable data storage, such as object
  storage.\nYet, many data-driven applications cannot use object interfaces
  directly and often have to rely on third-party file system co...\n\n-----
 ----------------\nEfficient Process-to-Node Mapping Algorithms for Stencil
  Computations\n\nvon Kirchbach, Lehr, Hunold, Schulz, Tr√§ff\n\nGood proces
 s-to-compute-node mappings can be decisive\nfor well performing HPC applic
 ations. A special, important\nclass of process-to-node mapping problems is
  the problem of\nmapping processes that communicate in a sparse stencil pa
 ttern\nto Cartesian grids. By thoroughly exploiting the inherently\npres..
 .\n\n---------------------\nCuVPP: Filter-based Longest Prefix Matching in
  Software Data Planes\n\nKwon, Neupane, Marshall, Rafique\n\nProgrammabili
 ty in the data plane has become increasingly important as virtualization i
 s introduced into networking and software-defined networking becomes more 
 prevalent. Yet, the performance of programmable data planes, often on comm
 odity hardware, is a major concern, especially in light of ever-i...\n
