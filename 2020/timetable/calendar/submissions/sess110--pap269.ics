SUMMARY:Profiling and Visualizing Performance of FPGAs in High-Performance
  Computing Environments
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nProfiling and Visualizing Performance of FPGAs in Hig
 h-Performance Computing Environments\n\nHuthmann, Podobas, Sommer, Koch, S
 ano\n\nThe recent maturity in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has renewed the i
 nterest of using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate High
 -Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Today, several studies have sho
 wn performance- and power-benefits of using FPGAs compared to existing app
 roaches for several HPC applications with ample room for improvements. Unf
 ortunately, tracing and visualizing the performance of applications runnin
 g on FPGAs is nearly non-existent, and understanding FPGA performance is o
 ften left to intuition or expert guesses.\n\nIn this work, we hypothesize 
 that existing profiling and visualization tools used in the HPC domain are
  suitable to visualize FPGA performance. Through several non-trivial hardw
 are extensions to support both event- and state-driven trace collection, w
 e show how modern HLS tools can support Paraver-- a state-of-the-art visua
 lization and profiling tool well-known in HPC. Finally, we show how contri
 bution can be used to visualize and provide unique insights into the execu
 tion of three well-known application kernels running on an FPGA, and how w
 e can use the visualization to guide optimizations
