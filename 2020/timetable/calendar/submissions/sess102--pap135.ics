SUMMARY:HAN: a Hierarchical AutotuNed Collective Communication Framework
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nHAN: a Hierarchical AutotuNed Collective Communicatio
 n Framework\n\nLuo, Wu, Bosilca, Pei, Cao...\n\nHigh-performance computing
  (HPC) systems keep growing in scale and heterogeneity to satisfy the incr
 easing computational need, and this brings new challenges to the design of
  MPI libraries, especially with regard to collective operations.\n\nTo add
 ress these challenges, we present "HAN," a new hierarchical autotuned coll
 ective communication framework in Open MPI, which selects suitable homogen
 eous collective communication modules as submodules for each hardware leve
 l, uses collective operations from the submodules as tasks, and organizes 
 these tasks to perform efficient hierarchical collective operations. With 
 a task-based design, HAN can easily swap out submodules, while keeping tas
 ks intact, to adapt to new hardware. This makes HAN suitable for the curre
 nt platform and provides a strong and flexible support for future HPC syst
 ems.\n\nTo provide a fast and accurate autotuning mechanism, we present a 
 novel cost model based on benchmarking the tasks instead of a whole collec
 tive operation. This method drastically reduces tuning time, as the cost o
 f tasks can be reused across different message sizes, and is more accurate
  than existing cost models. Our cost analysis suggests the autotuning comp
 onent can find the optimal configuration in most cases.\n\nThe evaluation 
 of the HAN framework suggests our design significantly improves the defaul
 t Open MPI and achieves decent speedups against state-of-the-art MPI imple
 mentations on tested applications.
