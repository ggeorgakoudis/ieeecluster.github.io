SUMMARY:CuVPP: Filter-based Longest Prefix Matching in Software Data Plane
 s
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nCuVPP: Filter-based Longest Prefix Matching in Softwa
 re Data Planes\n\nKwon, Neupane, Marshall, Rafique\n\nProgrammability in t
 he data plane has become increasingly important as virtualization is intro
 duced into networking and software-defined networking becomes more prevale
 nt. Yet, the performance of programmable data planes, often on commodity h
 ardware, is a major concern, especially in light of ever-increasing networ
 k link speed and routing table size. This paper focuses on IP lookup, spec
 ifically the longest prefix matching for IPv6 addresses, which is a major 
 performance bottleneck in programmable switches. As a solution, the paper 
 presents CuVPP, a programmable switch that uses packet batch processing an
 d cache locality for both instructions and data by leveraging Vector Packe
 t Processing (VPP). We thoroughly evaluate CuVPP with both real network tr
 affic and file-based lookup on a commodity hardware server connected via 8
 0~Gbps network links and compare its performance with the other popular ap
 proaches. Our evaluation shows that CuVPP can achieve up to 4.5 million lo
 okups per second with real traffic, higher than other trie- or filter-base
 d lookup approaches, and scales well even when the routing table size grow
 s to 2 million prefixes.
