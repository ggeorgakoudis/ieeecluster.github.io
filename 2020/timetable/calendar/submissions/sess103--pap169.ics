SUMMARY:Grade10: A Framework for Performance Characterization of Distribut
 ed Graph Processing
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nGrade10: A Framework for Performance Characterization
  of Distributed Graph Processing\n\nHegeman, Trivedi, Iosup\n\nGraph proce
 ssing is one of the most important and ubiquitous classes of analytical wo
 rkloads. To process large graph datasets with diverse algorithms, tens of 
 distributed graph processing frameworks emerged. Their users are increasin
 gly expecting high performance for diversifying workloads. Meeting this ex
 pectation depends on understanding the performance of each framework. Howe
 ver, performance analysis and characterization of a distributed graph proc
 essing framework is challenging. Contributing factors are the irregular na
 ture of\ngraph computation across datasets and algorithms, the semantic ga
 p between workload-level and system-level monitoring, and the lack of ligh
 tweight mechanisms for collecting fine-grained\nperformance data. Addressi
 ng the challenge, in this work we present Grade10, an experimental framewo
 rk for fine-grained performance characterization of distributed graph proc
 essing workloads. Grade10 captures the graph workload execution as a perfo
 rmance graph from logs and application traces, and builds a fine-grained, 
 unified workload-level and system-level\nview of performance. Grade10 samp
 les sparsely for lightweight monitoring and addresses the problem of accur
 acy through a novel approach for resource attribution. Last, it can identi
 fy automatically resource bottlenecks and common classes of performance is
 sues. Our real-world experimental evaluation with Giraph and PowerGraph, t
 wo state-of-the-art distributed graph\nprocessing systems, shows that Grad
 e10 can reveal large differences in the nature and severity of bottlenecks
  across systems and workloads. We also show that Grade10 can be used in de
 bugging processes, by exemplifying how we find with it a synchronization b
 ug in PowerGraph that slows down affected phases by 1.10âˆ’2.50x. Grad
 e10 is an open-source project available at https://github.com/atlarge-rese
 arch/grade10.
