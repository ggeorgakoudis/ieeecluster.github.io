SUMMARY:MonSTer: An Out-of-the-Box Monitoring Tool for High Performance Co
 mputing Systems
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nMonSTer: An Out-of-the-Box Monitoring Tool for High P
 erformance Computing Systems\n\nLi, Ali, Nguyen, Hass, Sill...\n\nUndersta
 nding the status of high-performance computing platforms and correlating a
 pplications to resource usage provide insight into the interactions among 
 platform components. A lot of efforts have been devoted into developing mo
 nitoring solutions; however, a large-scale HPC system usually requires a c
 ombination of methods/tools to successfully monitor all metrics, which wil
 l lead to a huge effort in configuration and monitoring. Besides, monitori
 ng tools are often left behind in the procurement of large-scale HPC syste
 ms. These challenges have motivated the development of a next-generation o
 ut-of-the-box monitoring tool that can be easily deployed without losing i
 nformative metrics.\n\nIn this work, we introduce MonSTer, an ``out-of-the
 -box'' monitoring tool for high-performance computing platforms. MonSTer u
 ses the evolving specification Redfish to retrieve sensor data from Basebo
 ard Management Controller (BMC), and resource management tools such as Uni
 va Grid Engine (UGE) or Slurm to obtain application information and resour
 ce usage data. Additionally, it also uses a time-series database (e.g. Inf
 luxDB) for data storage. MonSTer correlates applications to resource usage
  and reveals insightful knowledge without having additional overhead on th
 e application and computing nodes. This paper presents the design and impl
 ementation of MonSTer, as well as experiences gained through real-world de
 ployment on the 467-node Quanah cluster at Texas Tech University's High Pe
 rformance Computing Center (HPCC) over the past year.
