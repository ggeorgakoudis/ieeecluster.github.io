SUMMARY:E2Clab: Exploring the Computing Continuum through Repeatable, Repl
 icable and Reproducible Edge-to-Cloud Experiments
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nE2Clab: Exploring the Computing Continuum through Rep
 eatable, Replicable and Reproducible Edge-to-Cloud Experiments\n\nRosendo,
  Silva, Simonin, Costan, Antoniu\n\nDistributed digital infrastructures fo
 r computation and analytics are now evolving towards an interconnected eco
 system allowing complex applications to be executed from IoT Edge devices 
 to the HPC Cloud (aka the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or t
 he Transcontinuum). Understanding end-to-end performance in such a complex
  continuum is challenging. This breaks down to reconciling many, typically
  contradicting application requirements and constraints with low-level inf
 rastructure design choices. One important  challenge is to accurately repr
 oduce relevant behaviors of a given application workflow and representativ
 e settings of the physical infrastructure underlying this complex continuu
 m. In this paper we introduce a rigorous methodology for such a process an
 d validate it through E2Clab.  It is the first platform to support the com
 plete analysis cycle of an application on the Computing Continuum: (i) the
  configuration of the experimental environment, libraries and frameworks; 
 (ii) the mapping between the application parts and machines on the Edge, F
 og and Cloud; (iii) the deployment of the application on the infrastructur
 e; (iv) the automated execution; and (v) the gathering of experiment metri
 cs. We illustrate its usage with  a real-life application deployed on the 
 Grid'5000 testbed, showing that our framework allows one to understand and
  improve performance, by correlating it to the parameter settings, the res
 ource usage and the specifics of the underlying infrastructure.
