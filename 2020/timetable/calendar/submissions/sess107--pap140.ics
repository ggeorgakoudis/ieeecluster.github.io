SUMMARY:Exploring the Potential of Fast Delta Encoding: Marching to a High
 er Compression Ratio
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nExploring the Potential of Fast Delta Encoding: March
 ing to a Higher Compression Ratio\n\nTan, Zhang, Zou, Liao, Xia\n\nDelta c
 ompression (or called delta encoding) is a data reduction technique capabl
 e of calculating the differences (i.e., delta) among the very similar file
 s and chunks, and is thus widely used for optimizing synchronization repli
 cation, backup/archival storage, cache compression, etc. However, delta co
 mpression is costly because of its time-consuming wordmatching operations 
 for delta calculation. Existing delta encoding approaches, are either at a
  slow encoding speed, such as Xdelta and Zdelta, or at a low compression r
 atio, such as Ddelta and Edelta. In this paper, we propose Gdelta, a fast 
 delta encoding approach with a high compression ratio, that improves the d
 elta encoding speed by employing an improved fast Gear-based rolling hash 
 for scanning fine-grained words, and a quick arraybased indexing scheme fo
 r word-matching, and then, after wordmatching, further batch compressing t
 he rest to improve the compression ratio. Our evaluation results driven by
  six real-world datasets suggest that Gdelta achieves encoding/decoding sp
 eedups of 2X∼4X over the classic Xdelta and Zdelta approaches while 
 increasing the compression ratio by about 10%∼120%.
