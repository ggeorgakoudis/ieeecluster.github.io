SUMMARY:SSP: Speeding up Small Flows for Proactive Transport in Datacenter

DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nSSP: Speeding up Small Flows for Proactive Transport 
 in Datacenters.\n\nBai, Dong, Huan, Zhou, Liao\n\nProactive transport nowa
 days has drawn much attention because of fast convergence, near-zero queue
 ing and low latency. Proactive protocols, however, need an extra RTT to al
 locate ideal sending rate for new flows. To solve this, some studies, such
  as pHost, Homa, send unscheduled packets with line rate in the first RTT,
  which will causes severe network congestion. To avoid queue buildup, Aeol
 us directly drops unscheduled packets when congestion occurs. Nevertheless
 , based on our experiment, a considerable part of small flows (0-100KB) wi
 ll be completed in the first RTT under 100 Gbps network, so that dropping 
 unscheduled packets will severely affect performance of the small flows.\n
 \nIn this paper we propose SSP, a new scheme aimed to eliminate the extra 
 RTT delay and improve the FCT of small flows under proactive mechanisms. L
 ike pHost and Homa, SSP sends unscheduled packets at line rate when new fl
 ow arrives. Different from Aeolus, SSP selectively drops scheduled packets
  once queue buildup happens in switch, thus protecting unscheduled packets
  which are more likely belong to small flows. Besides, based on the short-
 job-first principle, we give relative higher priorities for small flows at
  the sender. Our simulation results with realistic workloads show that SSP
  can improve the FCT of small flows significantly. Specifically, under Web
  Search workload, SSP facilitates nearly 63% of 0-100 KB flows to complete
  one RTT faster. Also, SSP reduces the tail FCT by 56.8% at the 99th perce
 ntile compared with Expresspass and 29.2% compared with Aeolus while not l
 eads to large queue buildup.
