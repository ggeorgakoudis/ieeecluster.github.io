SUMMARY:Fast Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for High-dimensi
 onal Data
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nFast Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for
  High-dimensional Data\n\nK G, Vadhiyar\n\nK-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) searc
 h is one of the most commonly used approaches for similarity search. It fi
 nds extensive applications in machine learning and data mining. This era o
 f big data warrants efficiently scaling k-NN search algorithms for billion
 -scale datasets with high dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a solu
 tion towards this end where we use vantage point trees for partitioning th
 e dataset across multiple processes and exploit an existing graph-based se
 quential approximate k-NN search algorithm called HNSW (Hierarchical Navig
 able Small World) for searching locally within a process. Our hybrid MPI-O
 penMP solution employs techniques including exploiting MPI one-sided commu
 nication for reducing communication times and partition replication for be
 tter load balancing across processes. We demonstrate computation of k-NN f
 or 10,000 queries in the order of seconds using our approach on ~8000 core
 s on a dataset with billion points in a 128-dimensional space. We also sho
 w 10X speedup over a completely k-d tree-based solution for the same datas
 et, thus demonstrating better suitability of our solution for high dimensi
 onal datasets. Our solution shows almost linear strong scaling.
