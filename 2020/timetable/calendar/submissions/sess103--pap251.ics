SUMMARY:Modeling the Performance of Scientific Workflow Executions on HPC 
 Platforms with Burst Buffers
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nModeling the Performance of Scientific Workflow Execu
 tions on HPC Platforms with Burst Buffers\n\nPottier, Da Silva, Casanova, 
 Deelman\n\nScientific domains ranging from bioinformatics to astronomy and
  earth\nscience rely on traditional high-performance computing (HPC) codes
 , often\nencapsulated in scientific workflows. In contrast to traditional 
 HPC codes that\nemploy a few programming and runtime approaches that are h
 ighly\noptimized for HPC platforms, scientific workflows are not necessari
 ly\noptimized for these platforms. As an effort to reduce the gap between 
 compute \nand I/O performance, HPC platforms have adopted intermediate sto
 rage layers \nknown as burst buffers. A burst buffer (BB) is a fast\nstora
 ge layer positioned between the global parallel file system and the comput
 e\nnodes. Two designs currently exist: (i) shared, where the BBs\nare loca
 ted on dedicated nodes; and (ii) on-node, in which\neach compute node embe
 ds a private BB.\nIn this paper, using accurate simulations and real-world
  experiments, we\nstudy how to best use these new storage layers when exec
 uting scientific\nworkflows. These applications are not necessarily optimi
 zed to run on HPC\nsystems, and thus can exhibit I/O patterns that differ 
 from that of HPC codes.\nThus, we first characterize the I/O behaviors of 
 a real-world workflow under\ndifferent configuration scenarios on two lead
 ership-class HPC systems \n(Cori at NERSC and Summit at ORNL).\nThen, we u
 se these characterizations to calibrate a simulator for workflow\nexecutio
 ns on HPC systems featuring shared and private BBs.\nLast, we evaluate our
  approach against a large I/O-intensive workflow, \nand we provide insight
 s on the performance levels and the potential\nlimitations of these two BB
 s architectures.
