SUMMARY:NeoMPX: Characterizing and Improving Estimation of Multiplexing Ha
 rdware Counters for PAPI
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nNeoMPX: Characterizing and Improving Estimation of Mu
 ltiplexing Hardware Counters for PAPI\n\nWang, Wang, Chen, Zuo, Su...\n\nM
 odern processors provide hundreds of low-level hardware events (such as ca
 che miss rate), but offer only a small number (usually 6â€“12) of hardware c
 ounters to collect these events due to limited register resource. Multiple
 xing (MPX) is an estimation-based technique designed to collect hardware e
 vents simultaneously with few hardware counters. However, the lowaccuracy 
 of existing MPX methods prevents this technique from wide usage in real co
 nditions. To obtain accurate and reliable hardware counter values, we cond
 ucted this work in three steps: 1) to explore the root cause of inaccuracy
 , we characterized the estimation errors of MPX, and found that estimation
  errors arise from the outliers in PAPI; 2) to eliminate these outliers an
 d improve MPX accuracy, we proposed two non-linear growth rate gradient es
 timation methods: divided curved-area method (DCAM) and curved-area method
  (CAM); 3) based on these two methods, we developed a new MPX library for 
 PAPI, NeoMPX. We evaluated NeoMPX with six Rodinia benchmarks on four main
 stream x86 and ARM server processors, and compared the results with PAPI d
 efault MPX and two other state-of-art MPX methods, DIRA, and TAM. Evaluati
 ons show that, for collecting 16 evaluated hardware events, our methods ca
 n improve up to 59% accuracy than PAPI default MPX, and achieve 36% and 5%
  higher accuracy than DIRA and TAM, respectively. We have open-sourced Neo
 MPX and expect it to enable PAPI MPX for practical usage.
