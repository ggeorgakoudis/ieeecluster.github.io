SUMMARY:Parallel Particle Advection Bake-Off For Scientific Visualization 
 Workloads
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nParallel Particle Advection Bake-Off For Scientific V
 isualization Workloads\n\nBinyahib, Pugmire, Yenpure, Childs\n\nThere are 
 multiple algorithms for parallelizing particle advection for scientific vi
 sualization workloads. While many previous studies have contributed to the
  understanding of individual algorithms, our study aims to provide a holis
 tic understanding of how algorithms perform relative to each other on vari
 ous workloads. To accomplish this, we consider four popular parallelizatio
 n algorithms and run a “bake-off” study (i.e., an empirical study) to iden
 tify the best matches for each. The study includes 216 tests, going to a c
 oncurrency of up to 8192 cores and considering data sets as large as 34 bi
 llion cells with 300 million particles. Overall, our study informs three i
 mportant research questions: (1) which parallelization algorithms perform 
 best for a given workload?, (2) why?, and (3) what are the unsolved proble
 ms in parallel particle advection? In terms of findings, we find that the 
 seeding box is the most important factor in choosing the best algorithm, a
 nd also that there is a significant opportunity for improvement in executi
 on time, scalability, and efficiency.
