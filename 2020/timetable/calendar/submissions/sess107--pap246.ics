SUMMARY:Streaming File Transfer Optimization for Distributed Science Workf
 lows
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nStreaming File Transfer Optimization for Distributed 
 Science Workflows\n\nUcar, Arslan\n\nDriven by the advancements in computi
 ng and sensing technology, scientific applications started to generate a h
 uge volume of data which needs to be streamed to high-performance computin
 g clusters timely for real-time (or near-real time) processing, necessitat
 ing reliable network performance to operate seamlessly. However, existing 
 data transfer applications are predominantly designed for batch workloads 
 in a way that transfer configurations cannot be altered once they are set.
  This, in turn, severely limits streaming applications from adapting to ch
 anging dataset and network conditions therefore meeting stringent performa
 nce requirements. In this paper, we propose FStream to offer performance g
 uarantees to time-sensitive streaming applications by dynamically adjustin
 g transfer settings when system conditions deviate from initial assumption
 s to sustain high network performance throughout the runtime. We evaluate 
 the performance of FStream by transferring several synthetic and real-worl
 d workloads in high-performance production networks and show that it offer
 s up to 9x performance improvement over state-of-the-art data transfer sol
 utions.
