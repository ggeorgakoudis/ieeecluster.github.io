SUMMARY:Estimating Power Consumption of Containers and Virtual Machines in
  Data Centers
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nEstimating Power Consumption of Containers and Virtua
 l Machines in Data Centers\n\nZhang, Shen, Xia, Liu, Li\n\nVirtualization 
 technologies provide solutions of cloud computing. Virtual resource schedu
 ling is a crucial task in data centers, and the power consumption of virtu
 al resources is a critical foundation of virtualization scheduling. Contai
 ners are the smallest unit of virtual resource scheduling and migration. A
 lthough many effective models for estimating power consumption of virtual 
 machines (VM) have been proposed, few power estimation models of container
 s have been put forth. In this paper, we offer a fast-training piecewise r
 egression model based on decision tree to build a VM power estimation mode
 l and estimate the containersâ€™ power by treating the container as a group 
 of processes on the VM. In our model, we characterize the nonlinear relati
 onship between power and features and realize the effective estimation of 
 the containers on the VM. We evaluate the proposed model on 13 workloads i
 n PARSEC and compare it with several models. The experimental results prov
 e the effectiveness of our proposed model on most workloads. Moreover, the
  estimated power of the containers is in line with expectations.
