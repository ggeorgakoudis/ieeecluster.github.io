DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nE2Clab: Exploring the Computing Continuum through Rep
 eatable, Replicable and Reproducible Edge-to-Cloud Experiments\n\nRosendo,
  Silva, Simonin, Costan, Antoniu\n\nDistributed digital infrastructures fo
 r computation and analytics are now evolving towards an interconnected eco
 system allowing complex applications to be executed from IoT Edge devices 
 to the HPC Cloud (aka the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or t
 he Transcontinuum). Understanding end-to...\n\n---------------------\nExpl
 oring the Potential of Fast Delta Encoding: Marching to a Higher Compressi
 on Ratio\n\nTan, Zhang, Zou, Liao, Xia\n\nDelta compression (or called del
 ta encoding) is a data reduction technique capable of calculating the diff
 erences (i.e., delta) among the very similar files and chunks, and is thus
  widely used for optimizing synchronization replication, backup/archival s
 torage, cache compression, etc. However, delta...\n\n---------------------
 \nFlexible Data Redistribution in a Task-Based Runtime System\n\nCao, Bosi
 lca, Wu, Zhong, Bouteiller...\n\nData redistribution aims to reshuffle dat
 a to optimize some objective for an algorithm. The objective can be multi-
 dimensional, such as improving computational load balance or decreasing co
 mmunication volume or cost, with the ultimate goal to increase the efficie
 ncy and therefore decrease the time-t...\n\n---------------------\nA Stagi
 ng Based Task Execution Framework for Data-driven Scientific Workflows\n\n
 Wang, Subedi, Dorier, Davis, Parashar\n\nAs scientific workflows increasin
 gly use extreme-scale resources, the imbalance between higher computationa
 l capabilities, generated data volumes, and available I/O bandwidth is lim
 iting the ability to translate these scales into insights. In-situ workflo
 ws (and the in-situ approach) are leveraging ...\n\n---------------------\
 nStreaming File Transfer Optimization for Distributed Science Workflows\n\
 nUcar, Arslan\n\nDriven by the advancements in computing and sensing techn
 ology, scientific applications started to generate a huge volume of data w
 hich needs to be streamed to high-performance computing clusters timely fo
 r real-time (or near-real time) processing, necessitating reliable network
  performance to opera...\n
