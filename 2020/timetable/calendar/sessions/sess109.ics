SUMMARY:HPC Applications
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nFast Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for
  High-dimensional Data\n\nK G, Vadhiyar\n\nK-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) searc
 h is one of the most commonly used approaches for similarity search. It fi
 nds extensive applications in machine learning and data mining. This era o
 f big data warrants efficiently scaling k-NN search algorithms for billion
 -scale datasets with high dimensionality. In th...\n\n--------------------
 -\nA Hybrid MPI+PGAS Approach to Improve Strong Scalability Limits of Fini
 te Element Solvers\n\nJansson\n\nCurrent finite element codes scale reason
 ably well as long as each core has sufficient amount of local work that ca
 n balance communication costs. However, achieving efficient performance at
  exascale will require unreasonable large problem sizes, in particular for
  low-order methods, where the small a...\n\n---------------------\nTowards
  End-to-end SDC Detection for HPC Applications Equipped with Lossy Compres
 sion\n\nLi, Di, Zhao, Liang, Chen...\n\nData reduction techniques have bee
 n widely demanded and used by large-scale high performance computing (HPC)
  applications because of vast volumes of data to be produced and stored fo
 r post-analysis. Due to very limited compression ratios of lossless compre
 ssors, error-bounded lossy compression has b...\n\n---------------------\n
 Efficient Execution of Dynamic Programming Algorithms on Apache Spark\n\nJ
 avanmard, Ahmad, Zola, Pouchet, Chowdhury...\n\nOne of the most important 
 properties of distributed computing systems (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Ha
 doop, etc) on clusters and computation clouds is the ability to scale out 
 by adding more compute nodes to the cluster. This important feature can le
 ad to performance gain provided the computation (or ...\n\n---------------
 ------\nTowards Data-Flow Parallelization for Adaptive Mesh Refinement App
 lications\n\nSala, Rico, Beltran\n\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is a pr
 evalent method used by distributed-memory simulation applications to adapt
  the accuracy of their solutions depending on the turbulent conditions in 
 each of their domain regions. These applications are usually dynamic since
  their domain areas are refined or coars...\n
