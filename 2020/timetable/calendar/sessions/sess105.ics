DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nAnalysis of Cooling Water Temperature Impact on Compu
 ting Performance and Energy Consumption\n\nNonaka, Hanawa, Shoji\n\nThe ho
 t water cooling technique has been widely accepted as one of the standard 
 techniques to improve the energy efficiency for the HPC and Data Centers. 
 However, the higher operating temperature may impact the CPU power consump
 tion due to the leakage current. Moreover, it may degrade the computatio..
 .\n\n---------------------\nAutoscaling High-Throughput Workloads on Conta
 iner Orchestrators\n\nZheng, Kremer-Herman, Shaffer, Thain\n\nHigh-through
 put computing (HTC) workloads seek to complete as many jobs as possible ov
 er a long period of time. Such workloads require efficient execution of ma
 ny parallel jobs and can occupy a large number of resources for a long tim
 e, such that full utilization is the normal state of an HTC facili...\n\n-

 Performance Computing Systems\n\nLi, Ali, Nguyen, Hass, Sill...\n\nUnderst
 anding the status of high-performance computing platforms and correlating 
 applications to resource usage provide insight into the interactions among
  platform components. A lot of efforts have been devoted into developing m
 onitoring solutions; however, a large-scale HPC system usually requires...
 \n\n---------------------\nOpportunities and limitations of Quality-of-Ser
 vice in Message Passing applications on adaptively routed Dragonfly and Fa
 t Tree networks\n\nWilke, Kenny\n\nAvoiding communication bottlenecks rema
 ins a critical challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) as systems gr
 ow to exascale. Numerous design possibilities exist for avoiding network c
 ongestion including topology, adaptive routing, congestion control, and qu
 ality-of-service (QoS). While network d...\n\n---------------------\nSSP: 
 Speeding up Small Flows for Proactive Transport in Datacenters.\n\nBai, Do
 ng, Huan, Zhou, Liao\n\nProactive transport nowadays has drawn much attent
 ion because of fast convergence, near-zero queueing and low latency. Proac
 tive protocols, however, need an extra RTT to allocate ideal sending rate 
 for new flows. To solve this, some studies, such as pHost, Homa, send unsc
 heduled packets with line ra...\n\n---------------------\nQuantifying the 
 impact of network congestion on application performance and network metric
 s\n\nZhang, Groves, Cook, Wright, Coskun\n\nIn modern high-performance com
 puting (HPC) systems, network congestion is an important factor that contr
 ibutes to performance degradation. However, how network congestion impacts
  application performance is not fully understood. As Aries network, a rece
 nt HPC network architecture featuring a dragonfl...\n\n-------------------
 --\nDynamic Kernel Fusion for Bulk Non-contiguous Data Transfer on GPU Clu
 sters\n\nChu, Shafie Khorassani, Zhou, Subramoni, Panda\n\nIn the last dec
 ade, many scientific applications have been significantly accelerated by l
 arge-scale GPU systems.\nHowever, the movement of non-contiguous GPU-resid
 ent data is one of the most challenging parts to scale these applications 
 using communication middleware like MPI.\nAlthough plenty of rese...\n
