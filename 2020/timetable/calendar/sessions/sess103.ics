SUMMARY:Performance Characterization and Scheduling
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nNeoMPX: Characterizing and Improving Estimation of Mu
 ltiplexing Hardware Counters for PAPI\n\nWang, Wang, Chen, Zuo, Su...\n\nM
 odern processors provide hundreds of low-level hardware events (such as ca
 che miss rate), but offer only a small number (usually 6–12) of hardware c
 ounters to collect these events due to limited register resource. Multiple
 xing (MPX) is an estimation-based technique designed to collect hardware e
 ven...\n\n---------------------\nGrade10: A Framework for Performance Char
 acterization of Distributed Graph Processing\n\nHegeman, Trivedi, Iosup\n\
 nGraph processing is one of the most important and ubiquitous classes of a
 nalytical workloads. To process large graph datasets with diverse algorith
 ms, tens of distributed graph processing frameworks emerged. Their users a
 re increasingly expecting high performance for diversifying workloads. Mee
 ting ...\n\n---------------------\nEvaluating Worksharing Tasks on Distrib
 uted Environments\n\nMaroñas, Teruel, Bull, Ayguadé, Beltran\n\nHybrid pro
 gramming is a promising approach to exploit clusters of multicore systems.
  Our focus is on the combination of MPI and tasking. This hybrid approach 
 combines the low-latency and high throughput of MPI with the flexibility o
 f tasking models and their inherent ability to handle load imbalance...\n\
 n---------------------\nCo-scheML: Interference-aware Container Co-schedul
 ing Scheme using Machine Learning Application Profiles for GPU Clusters\n\
 nKim, Kim\n\nRecently, efficient execution of applications on Graphic Proc
 essing Unit(GPU) has emerged as a research topic to increase overall syste
 m throughput in cluster environment. As a current cluster orchestration pl
 atform using GPUs only supports an exclusive execution of an application o
 n a GPU, the plat...\n\n---------------------\nModeling the Performance of
  Scientific Workflow Executions on HPC Platforms with Burst Buffers\n\nPot
 tier, Da Silva, Casanova, Deelman\n\nScientific domains ranging from bioin
 formatics to astronomy and earth\nscience rely on traditional high-perform
 ance computing (HPC) codes, often\nencapsulated in scientific workflows. I
 n contrast to traditional HPC codes that\nemploy a few programming and run
 time approaches that are highly\noptimized fo...\n\n---------------------\
 nResilient Scheduling of Moldable Jobs on Failure-Prone Platforms\n\nBenoi
 t, Le Fèvre, Perotin, Raghavan, Robert...\n\nThis paper focuses on the res
 ilient scheduling of moldable parallel jobs on high-performance computing 
 (HPC) platforms. Moldable jobs allow for choosing a processor allocation b
 efore execution, and their execution time obeys various speedup models. Th
 e objective is to minimize the overall completion...\n
