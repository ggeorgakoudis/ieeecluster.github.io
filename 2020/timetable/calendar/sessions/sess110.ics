SUMMARY:IO, Visualization, and Machine Learning
DESCRIPTION:Paper\n\nECS2: A Fast Erasure Coding Library for GPU-Accelerat
 ed Storage Systems With Parallel & Direct IO\n\nChang, Chou, Chou, Chung\n
 \nAs data volume keeps increasing in a rapid rate, there is an urgent need
  for large, reliable and cost-effective storage systems. Erasure coding ha
 s drawn increasing attention because of its ability to ensure data reliabi
 lity with higher storage efficiency, and it has been widely adopted in man
 y dist...\n\n---------------------\nParallel Particle Advection Bake-Off F
 or Scientific Visualization Workloads\n\nBinyahib, Pugmire, Yenpure, Child
 s\n\nThere are multiple algorithms for parallelizing particle advection fo
 r scientific visualization workloads. While many previous studies have con
 tributed to the understanding of individual algorithms, our study aims to 
 provide a holistic understanding of how algorithms perform relative to eac
 h other o...\n\n---------------------\ntf-Darshan: Understanding Fine-grai
 ned I/O Performance in Machine Learning Workloads\n\nChien, Podobas, Peng,
  Markidis\n\nMachine Learning applications on HPC systems have been gainin
 g popularity in recent years. The upcoming large scale systems will offer 
 tremendous parallelism for training through GPUs. However, another heavy a
 spect of Machine Learning is I/O, and this can potentially be a performanc
 e bottleneck. Ten...\n\n---------------------\nProfiling and Visualizing P
 erformance of FPGAs in High-Performance Computing Environments\n\nHuthmann
 , Podobas, Sommer, Koch, Sano\n\nThe recent maturity in High-Level Synthes
 is (HLS) has renewed the interest of using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays 
 (FPGAs) to accelerate High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Today
 , several studies have shown performance- and power-benefits of using FPGA
 s compared to existing approaches for...\n\n---------------------\nOptimiz
 ing GPU Memory Transactions for Convolution Operations\n\nLu, Zhang, Wang\
 n\nCnvolution computation is a common operation in deep neural networks (D
 NNs) and is often responsible for performance bottlenecks during training 
 and inferencing. Existing approaches for accelerating convolution operatio
 ns aim to reduce computational complexity. However, these strategies often
  increa...\n\n---------------------\nData Life Aware Model Updating Strate
 gy for Stream-based Online Deep Learning\n\nRang, Yang, Cheng, Suo, Chen\n
 \nMany deep learning applications deployed in dynamic environments change 
 over time, in which the training models are supposed to be continuously up
 dated with streaming data in order to guarantee better descriptions on dat
 a trends. However, most of the state-of-the-art learning frameworks suppor
 t well...\n
