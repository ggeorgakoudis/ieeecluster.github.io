IEEE Cluster 2020 is the 22nd edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series.

Clusters remain the primary system architecture for building many of today’s rapidly evolving computing infrastructures and are used to solve some of the most world’s most complex problems. The challenges to make them scalable, efficient, productive, and increasingly effective requires a community effort in the areas of cluster system design, advancing the capabilities of the software stack, system management and monitoring, and the design of algorithms, methods, and applications to leverage the overall infrastructure.

Following the successes of previous IEEE Cluster conferences, for IEEE Cluster 2020, which will be held September 14 - 17, 2020 in Kobe, we again solicit high-quality original work that advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields. All papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate novel research contributions while papers reporting experiences must clearly describe the lessons learned and the resulting impact, along with the utility of the approach in comparison to previous work.

Authors must indicate the primary topic area of their submissions from the four topic areas provided below. In addition, they may optionally rank their paper relative to the overall set of topics. The papers may be submitted as either a full 10-page paper or as a shorter 4-page paper submission. Please note that references are not counted in the limits on the number of pages and a 10-page submission may be accepted with a caveat of transforming it into a 4-page version for presentation at the conference.

### Paper Submission:
- Submissions must be in PDF format. Since the camera-ready version of accepted papers must be compliant with the IEEE Xplore format for publication, submitted papers must conform to the following Xplore layout, page limit, and font size.
- Submissions are required to be no more than 10 pages (excluding references).
- Submissions must be single-spaced, 2-column numbered pages in IEEE Xplore format (8.5x11-inch paper, margins in inches – top: 0.75, bottom: 1.0, sides:0.625, and between columns:0.25, main text: 10pt).
- Papers will NOT be reviewed double-blind. Author names and affiliations should be included in the submitted paper, and appropriate citations of prior work must be included.
- LaTeX and Word Templates are available [here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
- Only web-based submissions are allowed.
- Please submit your paper via the [online submission system](https://clustercomp.org/submit)
