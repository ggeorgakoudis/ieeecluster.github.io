                             CALL FOR POSTERS
  22nd IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (IEEE Cluster 2020)
                    Kobe, Japan, September 14-17, 2020.

                Special Announcement for COVID-19 Situation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The safety of all conference participants is our first priority. After careful
discussion and consideration under the COVID-19 situation, the conference 
organizers decided to take the form of a virtual poster session where authors 
and participants can have online discussion.

Details:
1. Poster presentation materials are accessible online during the conference
2. The conference provides an online conference system to authors and participants
3. Authors and participants will have opportunity of online discussion 
during the designated time period.

This decision does not impact the IEEE publication of accepted poster abstracts 

Again, the safety of all conference participants is our first priority.
Your understanding is appreciated.

Overview:

Clusters remain the primary system architecture for building many of today's
rapidly evolving computing infrastructures and are used to solve some of the
most world's most complex problems. The challenges to make them scalable,
efficient, productive, and increasingly effective requires a community effort
in the areas of cluster system design, advancing the capabilities of the
software stack, system management and monitoring, and the design of
algorithms, methods, and applications to leverage the overall infrastructure.

Following the successes of previous IEEE Cluster conferences, for IEEE Cluster
2020, we again solicit high-quality original work that advances the
state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields. All posters will be
rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth and correctness,
potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of presentation.

Poster Submission:

The extended abstract should be structured similar to a technical paper, and may not
exceed 2 letter-sized (8.5 x 11) pages including figures, tables and references using the
IEEE format for conference proceedings (PDF, single-spaced, double column, 10pt text).
Extended abstracts and posters will NOT be reviewed double-blind. Author names and
affiliations should be included in the submission, and appropriate citations of prior work
must be included. If accepted, this extended abstract will be published in the proceedings
of the conference.
