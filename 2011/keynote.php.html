<p style="margin-top:0;">Louisiana State University<br />USA</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thomas Sterling</strong> is the Arnaud and Edwards Professor of Computer Science at the Louisiana
State University (LSU) Department of Computer Science, Adjunct Professor of the LSU
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and System Science and Engineering Focus
Area Head of the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT). He also serves as a
Distinguished Visiting Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CSRI Fellow at Sandia
National Laboratories. Since receiving his Ph.D. from MIT in 1984 as a Hertz Fellow he has
engaged in applied research in related fields associated with parallel computing system
structures, semantics, and operation in industry, government labs, and academia. Dr. Sterling is
best known as the "father of Beowulf" for his pioneering research in commodity/Linux cluster
computing. He was awarded the Gordon Bell Prize in 1997 with his collaborators for this work.
Thomas Sterling currently leads the ParalleX Research Group to devise a new model of 
computation establishing the foundation principles to guide the co-design for the development of
future generation Exascale computing systems by the end of this decade. His research has been
sponsored by NSF, NASA, NSA, DOE, DARPA, Army Core of Engineers, and Microsoft. He is
the co-author of six books and holds six patents.</p>
