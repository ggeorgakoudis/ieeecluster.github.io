                       Call for Papers
     2006 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing
                        (Cluster 2006)
           September 25-28, 2006, Barcelona, Spain
                  http://www.cluster2006.org

                        Sponsored by:
      IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC) 
=================================================================

------
Scope:
------

In less than a decade, clusters of commodity PCs have become the 
most cost-effective computing platforms for executing a wide 
range of high performance applications, from molecular biology to 
search and indexing on the internet.

In spite of countless deployed platforms and resounding 
application successes, many research and development challenges 
remain for achieving better cluster performance, scalability, and 
usability. The IEEE TCSC sponsored International Conference on 
Cluster Computing 2006 provides an open forum for researchers, 
practitioners, and users to present and discuss issues, directions, 
and results that will shape the future of cluster computing.

As cluster architecture is becoming a more mature field of 
application, it remains particularly important to maintain an event 
that links academic interests and new ideas to experience reports 
of practitioners and applications developers.

Cluster 2006 welcomes paper and poster submissions from engineers 
and scientists in academia and industry, describing original 
research work in all areas of cluster computing. Topics of interest 
include, but are not limited to:

	Cluster networking
	Performance analysis and evaluation
	Cluster management and maintenance
	Cluster software and middleware
	Cluster storage and I/O subsystems
	Clustering for high availability
	Applications
	Grid computing and clusters

-----------------
Paper Submission:
-----------------

Format for submission: full paper drafts, not to exceed 25 
double-spaced, numbered pages (including title, author affiliations, 
abstract, keywords, figures, tables, and bibliographic references) 
using 12 point font on 8.5x11-pages with 1-inch margins all around.

A web based submission mechanism will be activated on the conference 
web site (www.cluster2006.org) a few weeks before the submission 
deadline. Authors should submit a PostScript (level2) or PDF file. 
Hard copy submissions will not be accepted.

An extended version of the best papers will be published in the 
Cluster Computing Journal, published by Springer Science+Business 
Media B.V.

-------------------
Last Minute Papers:
-------------------

In addition to regular papers, and for late-breaking results, 
Cluster 2006 will accept a limited number of papers for consideration 
in a special session. These papers will be reviewed, and accepted 
papers will be included in a hardcopy supplement to the proceedings.  
If you are interested in this option, please submit an abstract by 
the regular paper deadline (April 28th) and the full paper by August 
4th.  Papers considered for this category must be particularly timely 
and the abstract submitted must contain a brief explanation on why 
the paper should be considered for this session.

---------------
Panel Proposal:
---------------

Panel proposals are solicited for the Cluster 2006 panel, in any of 
the topics of interest listed in the scope of this conference. Panel 
proposals that focus on novel and/or contentious aspects of cluster 
computing are particularly encouraged. 

A panel proposal should be between 1 and 3 pages with the same format 
as that of a technical paper. If possible, the panel should include 
names/affiliations of tentative panelists.

Submission information will be placed in the conference web page a 
few weeks before the deadline.

------------------
Tutorial Proposal:
------------------

Tutorial proposals are solicited for Cluster 2006, in any of the 
topics of interest listed in the scope of this conference.

A tutorial proposal should include a brief description of the 
tutorial outline, a description of the intended audience, and a 
biographical sketch of the instructor(s).

Submission information will be placed in the conference web page a 
few weeks before the deadline.

------------------
Workshop Proposal:
------------------

Cluster2006 expects to hold a small number of workshops immediately 
after the main technical sessions. We expect that some of these 
workshops will be continuations from past years (such as RAIT and 
HeteroPar), but we are also interested in exploring the possibilities 
that new workshops might offer the Cluster2006 attendees.

Submission information will be placed in the conference web page a 
few weeks before the deadline.
