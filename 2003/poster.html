      <p>The poster session will be held during the reception on
Tuesday, <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;">2
December</span> from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.<br>
      <br>
Here are the specific details for the session: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We will provide a poster
display board that is of size <span
 style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">1m x 2m</span>, and
we will supply the necessary
stationaries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>We have prepared a series of poster templates (in ppt
format) to aid the poster design. There is space for you to enter the
title of the poster paper and the authors' names. The rest is for
placing your presentation materials. Roughly speaking, the space is
large enough for six A4-size presentation notes. [<a href="black.ppt">Template1</a>]&nbsp;
[<a href="blue.ppt">Template2</a>] [<a href="green.ppt">Template3</a>] [<a
 href="red.ppt">Template4</a>]</li>
        <li>We could provide the printing service if authors send in
their completed design of the poster on or before 15 November, 2003.
Please send your completed design by email to cluster2003@csis.hku.hk. 
If the filesize of the completed poster design is too large to be handled 
by email, please send us the URL and we can download it from your site.</li>
        <li>If we do not receive your completed poster design, we will
print a blank poster with your paper title and the authors' names on
it. Authors could simply prepare their presentation materials on six
A4-size notes, and stick their notes on top of the printed poster.<br>
