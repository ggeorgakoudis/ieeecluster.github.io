Cluster 2003
IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing 
December 1-4, 2003, Hong Kong


URL: http://www.csis.hku.hk/cluster2003/

Organized by Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, 
The University of Hong Kong


Clusters today are an important element of mainstream computing. In
less than a decade, "lowly" computer clusters have come to prominence
as the most convenient and cost-effective tool for solving many
complex computational problems. Being able to bring enough computing
cycles together in a pool is one thing, but to be able to use these
cycles efficiently so that the aggregate power of a cluster can be
fully harnessed is another. Research and development efforts must
continue to explore better strategies to make clusters an even greater
tool when facing the grandest challenges of this age.  Cluster 2003,
to be held in the most dynamic city in the Orient, will provide an open
forum for cluster researchers and system builders, as well as cluster
users, to present and discuss new directions and results that could
shape the future of cluster computing.

Cluster 2003 welcomes paper submissions from engineers and scientists
in academia, industry, and government describing their latest research
findings in any aspects of cluster computing. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

Cluster Middleware
-- Single-System Image Services
-- Software Environments and Tools
-- Standard Software for Clusters
-- I/O Libraries, File Systems, and Distributed RAID

Cluster Networking
-- High-Speed System Interconnects
-- Lightweight Communication Protocols
-- Fast Message Passing Libraries

Managing Clusters
-- Cluster Security and Reliability
-- Tools for Managing Clusters
-- Cluster Job and Resource Management
-- High-Availability Cluster Solutions

Applications
-- Scientific and E-Commerce Applications
-- Data Distribution and Load Balancing
-- Innovative Cluster Applications

Performance Analysis and Evaluation
-- Benchmarking and Profiling Tools
-- Performance Prediction and Modeling
-- Analysis and Visualization

Grid Computing and Clusters
-- Grid Applications Integration
-- Network-Based Distributed Computing
-- Mobile Agents and Java for Clusters/Grids
-- Middleware, Tools and Environments

Paper Submission:
Paper Format: Not to exceed 25 double-spaced pages (including figures,
tables and references) using 10-12 point font on 8.5 x 11-inch
pages. Show page number at each page. Include an abstract, five to ten
keywords, and the corresponding author's e-mail address.

Electronic Submission: Web-based submissions are strongly
encouraged. The URL will be announced two weeks before the submission
deadline at the conference web site. Authors should submit a
PostScript (level 2) or PDF file. Postal submissions are not accepted.

Journal Special Issue:
Authors of the best papers from the conference will be invited to submit an
expand version of their papers for possible publication in a special issue
of the International Journal of High Performance Computing and
Networking (IJHPCN), which will appear in 2004.
