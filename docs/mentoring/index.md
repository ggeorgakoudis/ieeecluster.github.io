			<p>The Student Mentoring Program at IEEE Cluster 2021 is a program for PhD, Masters, and Undergraduate students to help students build their scientific careers. While the scientific presentations and interactions with conference attendees during the conference help students develop their technical skills, the Student Mentoring Program complements and extends this development by fostering the integration of the students into the Cluster scientific community, advising them to plan their professional career in academia or industry, improving their scientific communication skills, and providing them with the right entry points for efficient professional networking.</p>
      <h2>Applying to the Mentoring Program</h2>
      <p>All interested students can apply through a simple process, by providing a short description of why they want to participate in the conference, information on any works submitted to the conference or associated workshops, the name of their advisor, and their CV. The student’s adviser should endorse the student’s application and will be contacted once the application is submitted.</p>
      <h2>Student attendance awards - for students at U.S. institutions</h2>
      <p>Thanks to the National Science Foundation, several attendance awards will be available for students enrolled in US institutions and participating in the Student Mentoring Program at the IEEE Cluster 2021 conference. Students with accepted papers in the main conference track or in workshops, or students with posters must apply to and participate in the Student Mentoring Program to be eligible for the attendance award. Notice of awards will be made prior to the conference. The awards will be distributed post-conference in the form of reimbursements against registration expense submitted by the student. Both graduate and undergraduate students can apply.</p>
