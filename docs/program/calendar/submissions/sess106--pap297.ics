SUMMARY:Exploring HPC and Big Data Convergence: A Graph Processing Study o
 n Intel Knights Landing
DESCRIPTION:Exploring HPC and Big Data Convergence: A Graph Processing Stu
 dy on Intel Knights Landing\n\nUta, Varbanescu, Musaafir...\n\n\nThe quest
 ion “Can big data and HPC infrastructure converge?” has important implicat
 ions for many operators and clients of modern computing. However, answerin
 g it is challenging. The hardware is currently different, and fast evolvin
 g: big data uses machines with modest numbers of fat cores per socket, lar
 ge caches, and much memory, whereas HPC uses machines with larger numbers 
 of (thinner) cores, non-trivial NUMA architectures, and fast interconnects
 . In this work, we investigate the convergence of big data and HPC infrast
 ructure for one of the most challenging application domains, the highly ir
 regular graph processing. We contrast through a systematic, experimental s
 tudy of over 300,000 core-hours the performance of a modern multicore, Int
 el Knights Landing (KNL) and of traditional big data hardware, in processi
 ng representative graph workloads using state-of-the-art graph analytics p
 latforms. The experimental results indicate KNL is convergence-ready, perf
 ormance-wise, but only after extensive and expert-level tuning of software
  and hardware parameters.
