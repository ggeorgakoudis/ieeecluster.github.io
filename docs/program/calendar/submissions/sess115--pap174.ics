SUMMARY:Lightweight Requirements Engineering for Exascale Co-design
DESCRIPTION:Lightweight Requirements Engineering for Exascale Co-design\n\
 nCalotoiu, Graf, Hoefler...\n\n\nGiven the tremendous cost of an exascale 
 system, its architecture\n  must match the requirements of the application
 s it is supposed to\n  run as precisely as possible. Conversely, applicati
 ons must be\n  designed such that building an appropriate system becomes f
 easible,\n  motivating the idea of co-design. In this process, a fundament
 al\n  aspect of the application requirements are the rates at which the\n 
  demand for different resources grows as a code is scaled to a larger\n  m
 achine. However, if the anticipated scale exceeds the size of\n  available
  platforms this demand can no longer be measured. This is\n  clearly the c
 ase when designing an exascale system. Moreover,\n  creating analytical mo
 dels to predict these requirements is often\n  too laborious - especially 
 when the number and complexity of target\n  applications is high. In this 
 paper, we show how automated\n  performance modeling can be used to quickl
 y predict application\n  requirements for varying scales and problem sizes
 . Following this\n  approach, we determine the exascale requirements of fi
 ve scientific codes\n  and use them to illustrate system design tradeoffs.
