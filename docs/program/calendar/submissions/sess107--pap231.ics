SUMMARY:Modeling I/O performance variability using conditional variational
  auto encoders
DESCRIPTION:Modeling I/O performance variability using conditional variati
 onal auto encoders\n\nMadireddy, Balaprakash, Carns...\n\n\nStorage system
  performance modeling is crucial for \nefficient use of heterogeneous shar
 ed resources on leadership-class\ncomputers. \nVariability in application 
 performance, particularly variability arising\nfrom concurrent application
 s sharing I/O resources, \nis a major hurdle in the development of accurat
 e performance models. \nWe adopt a deep learning approach based on conditi
 onal variational auto \nencoders (CVAE) for I/O \nperformance modeling, an
 d use it to quantify performance variability. \nWe illustrate our approach
  using the data collected on Edison, a production\nsupercomputing system a
 t the National Energy Research Scientific Computing \nCenter (NERSC).\nThe
  CVAE approach is investigated by comparing it to a previously proposed\ns
 ensitivity-based Gaussian process (GP) model. We find that the CVAE model 
 \nperforms slightly better than the GP model in cases where training and t
 esting \ndata come from different applications, since CVAE can inherently 
 leverage the \nwhole data from multiple applications whereas GP partitions
  the data and \nbuilds separate models for each partition. \nHence, the CV
 AE offers an alternative modeling approach that does not\nneed pre-process
 ing; it has enough flexibility to handle data from a wide variety\nof appl
 ications without changing the inference approach.
