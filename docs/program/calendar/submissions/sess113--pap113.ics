SUMMARY:Neural network based silent error detector
DESCRIPTION:Neural network based silent error detector\n\nWang, Dryden, Ca
 ppello...\n\n\nAs we move toward exascale platforms, silent data corruptio
 ns (SDC) are likely to occur more frequently. Such errors can lead to inco
 rrect results. Attempts have been made to use generic algorithms to detect
  such errors. Such detectors have demonstrated high precision and recall f
 or detecting errors, but only if they run immediately after an error has b
 een injected. In this paper, we propose a neural network based detector th
 at can detect SDCs even multiple iterations after they were injected. We h
 ave evaluated our detector with 6 FLASH applications and 2 Mantevo mini-ap
 ps. Experiments show that our detector can detect more than 89% of SDCs wi
 th a false positive rate of less than 2%.
