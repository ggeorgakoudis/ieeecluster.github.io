SUMMARY:An Efficient Transformation Scheme for Lossy Data Compression with
  Point-wise Relative Error Bound
DESCRIPTION:An Efficient Transformation Scheme for Lossy Data Compression 
 with Point-wise Relative Error Bound\n\nLiang, Di, Tao...\n\n\nBecause of 
 the ever-increasing execution scale of scientific applications, how to sto
 re the extremely large volume of data efficiently is becoming a serious is
 sue. A significant reduction of the scientific data size can effectively m
 itigate the I/O burden and save considerable storage space. Since lossless
  compressors suffer from limited compression ratios, error-controlled loss
 y compressors have been studied for years. Existing error-controlled lossy
  compressors, however,  focus mainly on absolute error bounds, which canno
 t meet users' diverse demands such as pointwise relative error bounds. Alt
 hough some of the state-of-the-art lossy compressors support pointwise rel
 ative error bound, the compression ratios are generally low because of the
  limitation in their designs and possible spiky data changes in local data
  regions. In this work, we propose a novel, efficient approach to perform 
 compression based on the pointwise relative error bound with higher compre
 ssion ratios than existing solutions provide. Our contribution is threefol
 d. (1) We propose a novel transformation scheme that can transfer the poin
 twise relative-error-bounded compression problem to an absolute-error-boun
 ded compression issue. We also analyze the practical properties of our tra
 nsformation scheme both theoretically and experimentally. (2) We implement
  the proposed technique in two of the most popular absolute-error-bounded 
 lossy compressors, SZ and ZFP. (3) We evaluate our solution using multiple
  real-world application data across different scientific domains on a supe
 rcomputer with up to 4,096 cores and 12 TB of data. Experiments show that 
 our solution achieves over $1.38X$ dumping and $1.31X$ loading performance
  over the second-best lossy compressor, respectively.
