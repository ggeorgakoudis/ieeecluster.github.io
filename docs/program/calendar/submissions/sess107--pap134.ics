SUMMARY:OpenACC vs the Native Programming on Sunway TaihuLight: A Case Stu
 dy with GTC-P
DESCRIPTION:OpenACC vs the Native Programming on Sunway TaihuLight: A Case
  Study with GTC-P\n\nCai, Wang, Lin\n\n\nSunway TaihuLight is China's rece
 nt top-ranked supercomputer worldwide that was the first to be built entir
 ely with home-grown processors. This supercomputer can be programmed with 
 two approaches: directive-based OpenACC and native programming. These appr
 oaches are studied here using GTC-P, a particle-in-cell code for investiga
 ting micro-turbulence in magnetic fusion plasmas. We have compared the per
 formance and programming efforts between the OpenACC and the native versio
 n of GTC-P. Associated results show that in the OpenACC version, the kerne
 l with irregular memory access becomes the main performance bottleneck due
  to poor data locality. To address this issue, we have applied two optimiz
 ations on the native version: (1) register level communication (RLC); and 
 (2) an “asynchronization” strategy. With these two optimizations, the nati
 ve version can achieve up to 2.5X speedup for the memory-bound kernel comp
 ared with the OpenACC version. In addition, we have now scaled GTC-P on 4,
 259,840 cores of TaihuLight and demonstrate performance comparisons with s
 everal world-leading supercomputers.
