SUMMARY:HIDStore: A Hierarchical Intermediate Data Storage System for Seis
 mic Processing Application
DESCRIPTION:HIDStore: A Hierarchical Intermediate Data Storage System for 
 Seismic Processing Application\n\nWang, Zhao, Wang...\n\n\nSeismic process
 ing is an important technology in petroleum industry. During the execution
  of seismic processing applications, large amount of intermediate data are
  generated and accessed. Providing high-performance services for intermedi
 ate data in the traditional storage architecture is expensive. In addition
 , because of the existence of new storage devices, the heterogeneity of st
 orage environment has brought much inconvenience to the application develo
 pers and petroleum scientists. In this paper, we present a hierarchical in
 termediate data storage system called HIDStore. HIDStore employs distribut
 ed storage system based on the local storage devices and idle network reso
 urces to accelerate intermediate data access. Our experiments show that us
 ing HIDStore could improve the performance of various seismic processing a
 pplications and the resource utilization in compute cluster. HIDStore also
  abstracts different kinds of storage devices into hierarchical logical vo
 lumes and provides easy-to-use API to access data. Developers could deal w
 ith intermediate data in a high level of abstraction. Applications based o
 n the HIDStore could fit into different storage environment and gain optim
 al performance automatically. Intermediate data in HIDStore could be autom
 atically evicted once they expire.
