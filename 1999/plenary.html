<p><b><i>Abstract:</i></b>

Beowulf-class PC cluster computing and other PC cluster systems have
been in evolution for approximately 6 years driven by application
requirements, technology opportunities, and experience with earlier
workstation clusters and cycle harvesting on local area networks of desk
tops. PC cluster computing is in transition from its inchoate phase of
separate installed system implementation to shared community-wide
hardware and software systems with industry support. When once the
primary challenge was implementation of the hardware and programming end
applications on small or moderate sized systems, today the dominant
challenge is scalability beyond a thousand processors and the
development of robust system management software for large multiuser,
multitasking Beowulfs. The future directions for PC clusters will be, in
part, driven by advances and changes in trends in hardware technologies
including system-on-a-chip, processor-in-memory, and SMP-on-a-chip as
well as new optical technologies for inter-node communications. But not
all trends in technology will be conducive to future Beowulf-class
systems and computing. The movement to turnkey consumer boxes such as
set-top boxes, PDAs, and gameboys, are all inaccessible to being
harnessed in general purpose clusters. This talk will summarize the
range of accomplishments over the last half dozen years and will project
the likely opportunities, directions, paths, and degree of advances for
the next half dozen years. The talk will also reflect on the content and
implications of the presentations comprising the IWCC technical agenda.
