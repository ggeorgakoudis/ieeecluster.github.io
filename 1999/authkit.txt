AUTHOR GUIDELINES FOR 8.5 x 11-INCH PROCEEDINGS MANUSCRIPTS - IWCC'99

Congratulations on the acceptance of your paper for publication. Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your final paper to the IEEE Computer Society Press:

(1) ALL MANUSCRIPTS MUST BE IN ENGLISH.

(2) PRINTING YOUR PAPER. (For hard-copy.) Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, 8.5 x 11-inch white printer paper (A4 size is also acceptable).

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept within a print area 6-7/8 inches (approx. 17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (approx. 22.5 cm) high. Number your pages lightly in pencil on the back of each page. 

(3) PAGE AND COLUMN LAYOUT. Start the first page in a one-column format. Center your title about 3 lines down from the normal top of the print area. Follow the title with two blank lines. The author name(s) and affiliation(s) are next, centered beneath the title and followed by two blank lines.

Your Abstract and the remainder of the paper are to be in a two-column format (except for figures or tables that may span both columns if necessary). If the last page is not filled, please divide the data into two equal columns.

Columns in the two-column format are to be 3-1/4 inches wide (approx. 8.5 cm), with a 3/8-inch (approx. 1.0 cm) space between columns, for a total print area width of 6-7/8 inches (approx. 17.5 cm). The length of the print area of any page must not exceed 8-7/8 inches (approx. 22.5 cm).

(4) TYPE STYLE AND SIZE OF TEXT. Normal text is to be single spaced in 10-point Times or Times Roman(or similar font), with 12-point interline spacing, in the two-column format. The first line of each paragraph is to be indented approximately 1/4 inch (approx. 0.7 cm), and the entire text is to be justified -- that is, flush left and flush right. Please do not place additional line spacing between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be Helvetica 10-point boldface; callouts should be Helvetica 9-point nonboldface.

(5) ABSTRACTS. The Abstract should be approximately 150 words or fewer, italicized, in 10-point Times (or Times Roman.) Please leave two spaces between the Abstract and the heading of your first section.

AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF YOUR ABSTRACT -- INCLUDING THE CONFERENCE NAME, PAPER TITLE, KEYWORDS, AUTHOR NAMES, ADDRESSES, AND AFFILIATIONS -- MUST BE SENT TO THE IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY PRESS. THE ELECTRONIC COPY IS TO BE AN ASCII TEXT FILE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO THE INTERNET ADDRESS INDICATED IN THE COVER LETTER.

(6) TITLE AND HEADINGS. The main title should be in Times (or Times Roman) 14-point boldface centered over both columns. In the main title, please initially capitalize nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, and prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Initially capitalize only the first word in first-, second-, and third-order headings. Leave two blank lines before author names(s)/affiliation(s).

AUTHOR NAME(S)/AFFILIATION(S) are to be centered in Times (or Times Roman) 12-point nonboldface. Leave two blank lines before your Abstract.

ABSTRACT HEADING. The abstract heading is to be 11-point boldface, initially capitalized and centered within the column.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. First-order headings (for example, 1: Introduction) are to be Times 12-point boldface, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. Second-order headings (for example, 1.1: Database elements) are to be Times 11-point boldface, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), then it is to be in Times 10-point boldface, preceded by one blank line, and followed by a period and text on same line.

(7) ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS. Illustrations, graphs, and photographs may fit across both columns, if necessary. Your artwork must be in place in the article.  If you are printing a hard copy, use rubber cement to affix the artwork in place.

Although halftones can be shot from color prints, black and white photos are preferable. Please supply the best quality photographs and illustrations possible. The quality of the book cannot be better than the originals provided.

(8) USE OF TAPE. (For hard copy.) Do not place cellophane tape over any part of your text or graphics. (Cellophane tape may distort or obliterate what it covers, and it retains fingerprints and dirt smudges.)

(9) COLOR. The use of color on interior pages (that is, pages other than the cover) is prohibitively expensive. Consequently, we publish interior pages in color only when it is specifically requested and budgeted for by the conference organizers. If these proceedings are going to have color photos, you must provide a clearly marked slide with its corresponding plate number, your name, and the position of the slide (if there is more than one). You also need to identify the right side and the top of the slide. Please make a Xerox copy (or photocopy) of each photo (or a small, rough sketch) and attach it with rubber cement to show the intended size and location. Color photos are sent to a color separator before going to the printer, so it is essential that we have this information to ensure the correct display of your color graphics.

(10) FOOTNOTES. Use footnotes sparingly and place them at the bottom of the column in which they are referenced (not full width across two columns). Use Times 8-point type with 10-point interline spacing for footnotes. To help readers, avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in your text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).

(11) REFERENCES. List and number all bibliographical references at the end of your paper in 9-point Times, with 10-point interline spacing. When referenced within the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example [1].

(12) COPYRIGHT FORMS. You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit your finished paper. We must have this form before your paper can be published in the proceedings.

Questions not answered in these guidelines may be directed to an IEEE Computer Society Press production editor at: Phone (714) 821-8380, or Fax (714) 761-1784.

Notes and Information for Authors and Their Employers

IEEE POLICY:
In connection with its publishing activities, it is the formal policy of the IEEE to own the copyrights to all copyrightable material in its technical publications, and to the individual contributions contained therein, in order to protect the interests of the IEEE, its authors and their employers, and, at the same time, to facilitate the appropriate re-use of this material by others. The IEEE distributes its technical publications throughout the world and does so by various means such as hard copy, microfiche, microfilm, and electronic media. It also abstracts and may translate its publications, and articles contained therein, for inclusion in various compendiums and similar publications, etc. When an article is submitted for publication to the IEEE, the IEEE understands that its acceptance of the article implies that IEEE has the rights to do all of the things it normally does with such an article.

IEEE Policy 6.17 - Clearance of Papers - applies to all material submitted to IEEE:  "The IEEE must of necessity assume that material presented at its meetings or submitted to its publications is properly available for general dissemination to the audiences these activities are organized to serve. It is the responsibility of the authors, not the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their material requires the prior consent of other parties and, if so, to obtain it."

Furthermore, the IEEE must assume that, if an author uses within his/her article previously published and/or copyrighted material that permission has been obtained for such use and that any required credit lines, copyright notices, etc. are duly noted.

IEEE OBLIGATIONS:
In exercising its rights under copyright, the IEEE will make all reasonable efforts to act in the interests of the authors and employers as well as in its own interest. In handling third party reprint/republication requests for an IEEE work, IEEE requires that: 1) the consent of the first-named author be sought as a condition in granting republication (of a full paper) to others; and 2) the consent of the employer be obtained as a condition in granting permission to others to re-use all or portions of a paper for promotion or marketing purposes.

AUTHOR/COMPANY RIGHTS:
If you are employed and you prepared your paper as part of your job, the rights to your work rest initially with your employer. In that case, when you sign the copyright transfer form, we assume you are authorized to do so by your employer and that your employer has consented to all the terms and conditions of this form. If not, it should be signed by someone so authorized. (See also Policy 6.17 above.)

SPECIAL NOTE TO EMPLOYERS: Just as the IEEE requires a signed copyright transfer form (for copyrightable material) in order to do "business as usual," it is the intent of the transfer portion of the form to return rights to the author and employer so that they, too, may do "business as usual."

Please note that, although authors are permitted to reuse all or portions of their IEEE-copyrighted material in other works, this does not include granting third party requests for reprinting, republishing or other types of re-use. ALL THIRD-PARTY REQUESTS MUST BE HANDLED BY THE IEEE COPYRIGHTS & PERMISSION OFFICE. PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT IEEE COPYRIGHT POLICY OR THIS FORM TO:  

	Manager, Copyrights and Permissions, 
	IEEE Service Center, 445 Hoes Lane, 
	P.O. Box 1331, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1331.
