IWCC'99 Report</h1>
We are pleased to inform you that our Task Force's the first annual meeting:
<blockquote><a href="/1999/index.html">IEEE
International Workshop on Cluster Computing (IWCC'99)</a></blockquote>
held in Melbourne, Australia, Dec. 2-3, 19999 was successful. We had over
hundread participants registered for the meeting from five major continents
of the world: USA, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Brazil, Germany, China,
Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK; and Mexico as well as researchers
throughout Australia.
<p>The IWCC'99 program comprises of keynote talks, invited talks from industries,
regular sessions, poster session, and a panel on "Cluster Computing R &amp;
D in Australia". The program details and presentation slides of some of
invited/keynote/industry speakers can be found at the meetings web site.
<p>The proceedings has been published by IEEE CS Press and those who are
interested having one can get from the IEEE CS Press:
<blockquote><a href="http://services.ieee.org/titles/bwshop.htm">http://services.ieee.org/titles/bwshop.htm</a></blockquote>
and search for "Cluster Computing", you will get a link to order form.
<p>The proceedings will soon be available online at <a href="http://www.computer.org/">www.computer.org</a>
and all CS members can access it freely. We also created web-based online
proceedings for poster paper and it can be accessed from IWCC web site.

We would like to acknowledge Microsoft Research for their participation
and funding the participation of Mr. Beowulf, Thomas Sterling, as our plenary
speaker. Mr. Beowulf gave highly emotional talk on Beowulf-class computing
and future directions.
<p>The conference concluded with Thomas's talk reflecting on the content
and implications of the presentations comprising the IWCC technical agenda.
The Task Force would like announce that our second annual meeting in 2000
is scheduled to be held in Germany, for details, please see:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/cluster2000/">http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/cluster2000/</a></blockquote>
The word "workshop" has been replaced by "conference" officially and of
course everyone called IWCC'99 as IWCC conference (refused to call it as
workshop) due its conference scale technical agenda and a significant number
of participants from all over the world. The credit for its success goes
to all TFCC volunteers, IWCC'99 crew members, and participants.
<p>---
<br>The Task Force would like to thank all our members and volunteers for
supporting us in our first year of operation. And we are looking forward
working with you all next year in large scale.
<p>BTW, IWCC'99 conference along with Task Force activities will be featured
in the first issue of:
<ul>
<li>IEEE Concurrency Magazine</li>
<li>Asian Technology Information Program</li>
</ul>
in the year 2000. (check out <A href="http://www.ieeetfcc.org/press.html">TFCC Press pages</A>.)
<p>Have a great holiday season, merry christmas, and enjoy the arrival
of Y2K!
<p>Thank you very much.
