      <p><strong class="h2" style="color: #5231D9">CALL FOR STUDENT MENTORING PROGRAM</strong> The Student Mentoring Program is an opportunity to network with  senior colleagues and meet peers. Interested students can apply through a  simple, non-competitive procedure, by providing a 2-page description of their  personal vision for their career (i.e., where they come from, what they are  interested in, what their career objectives are) and, most importantly, what  their research vision is.  For example,  PhD students might wish to describe their PhD proposal and explain why their  contributions are relevant for the scientific community.  Students engage in successful projects can  provide a summary of the project and outline their own contributions. Students'  applications should be endorsed by the their advisers.</p>
      <p>All 2-page submissions will be reviewed for review by the Program  Committee, with a friendly feedback returned to the students. The objective is  to host as many motivated students as possible in the program. Note that there  is no endorsement of the scientific contents by the conference.</p>
      <p><strong class="h2" style="color: #5231D9">STUDENT TRAVEL AWARDS - FOR STUDENTS AT US INSTITUTIONS </strong>      Several travel awards are sponsored by  the National Science Foundation for students enrolled in US institutions and  participating in the Student Mentoring Program.

      <p>Notice of travel awards will be made  prior to the conference. The travel awards will be distributed post-conference  in the form of reimbursements against actual travel, registration, and  accommodation expenses submitted by the student.
