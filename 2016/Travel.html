      <h2>Formosa - beautiful island</h2>
      
        <img src="images/taiwan-map.jpg" width="218" height="260" align="left">Formosa is what  the Portuguese called Taiwan when they came here in the 16th century and saw  the island's verdant beauty.  Taiwan is  an island about 36,000 square km located off the coast of southeastern China,  southwest of Japan and north of the Philippines. It lies off the southeastern  coast of mainland Asia, across the Taiwan Strait from Mainland China. Taiwan is  one of the most unsung tourist destinations in all of Asia, its modern  emergence as an economic and industrial powerhouse still overshadowing the  staggering breadth of natural, historic and culinary attractions this  captivating island has to offer. A fascinating mix of technological innovation  and traditional Chinese and aboriginal cultures and cuisines.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Area: 36,000 square kilometers</li>
        <li>Population: 23 million</li>
