  <strong>Abstract<br>
  </strong>We  advocate the usage of mathematical models and abstractions in practical  high-performance computing. For this, we show a series of examples and  use-cases where the abstractions introduced by performance models can lead to  clearer pictures of the core problems and often provide non-obvious insights.  We start with models of parallel algorithms leading to close-to-optimal  practical implementations. We continue our tour with distributed-memory  programming models that provide various abstractions to application developers.  A short digression on how to measure parallel systems shows common pitfalls of  practical performance modeling. Application performance models based on such  accurate measurements support insight into the resource consumption and  scalability of parallel programs on particular architectures. We close with a  demonstration of how mathematical models can be used to derive practical  network topologies and routing algorithms. In each of these areas, we  demonstrate newest developments but also point to open problems. All these  examples testify to the value of modeling in practical high-performance  computing. We assume that a broader use of these techniques and the development  of a solid theory for parallel performance will lead to deep insights at many fronts.

      <p><strong>Abstract </strong><br>
      The rise of  big data science has created new demands for modern computer systems. While  floating point performance has driven computer architecture and system design  for the past few decades, there is renewed interest in the speed at which data  can be ingested and processed. Early exemplars such as Gordon, the NSF funded  system at the San Diego Supercomputing Centre, shifted the focus from pure  floating point performance to memory and IO rates. At the University of  Queensland we have continued this trend with the design of FlashLite, a  parallel cluster equiped with large amounts of main memory, Flash disk, and a  distributed shared memory system (ScaleMP&rsquo;s vSMP). This allows applications to  place data &ldquo;close&rdquo; to the processor, enhancing processing speeds. Further, we  have built a geographically distributed multi-tier hierarchical data fabric  called MeDiCI, which provides an abstraction of very large data stores across  the metropolitan area. MeDiCI leverages industry solutions such as IBM&rsquo;s  Spectrum Scale and SGI&rsquo;s DMF platforms. </p>
      <p>Caching  underpins both FlashLite and MeDiCI. In this talk I will describe the design  decisions and illustrate some early application studies that benefit from the  approach.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
        Clear trends in the past and current  petascale systems (i.e., Jaguar and Titan) and the new generation of systems  that will transition us toward exascale (i.e., Aurora and Summit) outline how  concurrency and peak performance are growing dramatically, however, I/O  bandwidth remains stagnant. Next-generation systems are expected to deliver 7  to 10 times higher peak floating-point performance with only 1 to 2 times  higher PFS bandwidth compared to the current generation.<br>
  <br>
        Data intensive applications, especially those exhibiting bursty I/O, must take  this aspect into consideration and be more selective about what data is written  to disk and how the data is written. In addressing the needs of these  applications, can we take advantage of a rapidly changing technology landscape,  including containerized environments, burst buffers, and in-situ/in-transit  analytics? Are these technologies ready to transition these applications to  exascale? In general, existing software components managing these technologies  are I/O-ignorant, resulting in systems running the data intensive applications  that exhibit contentions, hot spots, and poor performance.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
      In this talk, we explore challenges when dealing with I/O-ignorant high  performance computing systems and opportunities for integrating I/O awareness  in these systems. Specifically, we present solutions that use I/O awareness to  reduce contentions in scheduling policies managing under provisioned systems  with burst buffers, and to mitigate data movements in data-intensive  simulations. Our proposed solutions go beyond high performance computing and  develop opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
