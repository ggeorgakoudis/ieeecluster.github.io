      <p><strong class="h2">Why a Mentoring  Program at Cluster 2016?</strong>        Students  are our future! They are the future of our research and the Cluster community.  The Cluster conference launched a Mentoring Program for PhD, Master, and  Undergraduate students in 2014, as a service to the community.<br>
      The goal of this program is to help students participate in the  conference and build their scientific career as efficiently as possible. The  interaction with conference attendees will help student develop their technical  skills. The complements and extends the students&rsquo;  development by fostering the integration of students into the Cluster  scientific community, advising them to plan their professional career in  academia or industry, improving their scientific communication skills, and  providing the students with the right entry points for an efficient networking.</p>
      <p><strong class="h2">Travel Support for Students at American  Instructions</strong>        A limited number of NSF travel scholarships are available from full time  students at American universities; both undergraduate and graduate students are  eligible. Students from American universities with papers and posters at the  conference should apply for the Mentoring Program at Cluster 2016 in order to  be considered for the travel  scholarship. <br>
  <em>Note: Only full time students from </em><em>American universities</em><em> who apply for the </em><em>Mentoring Program at Cluster 2016 will be considered for the NSF travel  support.</em></p>
      <p><strong class="h2">Applying to the  Mentoring Program</strong>      The Student Mentoring Program is not just another publication  venue. All interested students can apply through a simple, non-competitive  procedure, by providing a 2-page description of their person vision for their  career, i.e., where they come from, what they are interested in, what their  career objectives are, and most importantly, what their research vision is. For  example, PhD students might wish to describe their PhD proposal and explain why  their contributions are relevant for the scientific community. The student&rsquo;s  adviser should endorse the student&rsquo;s application. Applicants should include the  name and e-mail of the advisor in the application. We will contact the advisor  for his/her endorsement. </p>
