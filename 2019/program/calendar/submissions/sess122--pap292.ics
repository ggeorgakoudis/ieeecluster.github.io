SUMMARY:Hybrid MPI+OpenMP Reactive Work Stealing in Distributed Memory in 
 the PDE Framework sam(oa)^2
DESCRIPTION:Hybrid MPI+OpenMP Reactive Work Stealing in Distributed Memory
  in the PDE Framework sam(oa)^2\n\nSamfass, Klinkenberg, Bader\n\n\n“Equal
  work results in equal execution time” is an\nassumption that has fundamen
 tally driven design and implemen-\ntation of parallel applications for dec
 ades. However, increasing\nhardware variability on current architectures (
 e.g., through\nTurbo Boost, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling or therm
 al\neffects) necessitate a revision of this assumption. Expecting an\nincr
 ease of these effects on future (exascale-)systems, we develop a\nnovel MP
 I+OpenMP-only distributed work stealing concept that\n– based on on-line p
 erformance monitoring – selectively steals\nand remotely executes tasks ac
 ross MPI boundaries. This concept\nhas been implemented in the parallel ad
 aptive mesh refinement\n(AMR) framework sam(oa)^2 for OpenMP tasks of trav
 ersing\na grid section. Corresponding performance measurements in\nthe pre
 sence of enforced CPU clock frequency imbalances\ndemonstrate that a state
 -of-the-art cost-based (chains-on-chains\npartitioning) load balancing mec
 hanism is insufficient and can\neven degrade performance, whereas addition
 al distributed work\nstealing successfully mitigates the frequency-induced
  imbalances.\nFurthermore, our results indicate that our approach is also\
 nsuitable for load balancing work-induced imbalances in a realistic\nAMR t
 est case.
