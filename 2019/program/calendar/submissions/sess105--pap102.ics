SUMMARY:Energy Analysis and Optimization for Resilient Linear Systems
DESCRIPTION:Energy Analysis and Optimization for Resilient Linear Systems\
 n\nMiao, Calhoun, Ge\n\n\nExascale computing must simultaneously address b
 oth energy efficiency and\nresilience as power limits impact scalability a
 nd faults are more common.\nUnfortunately, energy efficiency and resilienc
 e have been traditionally studied\nin isolation and optimizing one typical
 ly detrimentally impacts the other. To deliver the promised performance wi
 thin the given\npower budget, exascale computing mandates a deep understan
 ding of the interplay\namong energy efficiency, resilience, and scalabilit
 y.\n\nIn this work, we propose novel methods to analyze and optimize costs
  of\nresilience techniques including checkpoint-restart and forward recove
 ry for large sparse linear system solvers. In\nparticular, we present expe
 rimental and analytical methods to analyze and\nquantify the time and ener
 gy costs of recovery schemes on computer clusters. We\nfurther develop and
  prototype performance optimization and power management\nstrategies to im
 prove energy efficiency.  Experimental results show that\nrecovery schemes
  incur different time and energy overheads and optimization\ntechniques si
 gnificantly reduce such overheads. This work suggests that\nresilience tec
 hniques should be adaptively adjusted to a given fault rate, system\nsize,
  and power budget.
