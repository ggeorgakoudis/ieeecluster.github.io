SUMMARY:Elasticity in Graph Analytics? A Benchmarking Framework for Elasti
 c Graph Processing
DESCRIPTION:Elasticity in Graph Analytics? A Benchmarking Framework for El
 astic Graph Processing\n\nUta, Au, Ilyushkin...\n\n\nGraphs are a natural 
 fit for modeling concepts used in solving diverse problems in science, com
 merce, engineering, and governance. Responding to the diversity of graph d
 ata and algorithms, many parallel and distributed graph-processing systems
  exist. However, until now these platforms use a static model of deploymen
 t: they only run on a pre-defined set of machines. This raises many concep
 tual and pragmatic issues, including misfit with the highly dynamic nature
  of graph processing, and could lead to resource waste and high operationa
 l costs. In contrast, in this work we explore the benefits and drawbacks o
 f the dynamic model of deployment. Building a three-layer benchmarking fra
 mework for assessing elasticity in graph analytics, we conduct an in-depth
  elasticity study of distributed graph processing. Our framework is compos
 ed of state-of-the-art workloads, autoscalers, and metrics, derived from t
 he LDBC Graphalytics benchmark and SPEC RG Cloud Groupâ€™s elasticity metric
 s. We uncover the benefits and cost of elasticity in graph processing: whi
 le elasticity allows for fine-grained resource management, and does not de
 grade application performance, we find that graph workloads are sensitive 
 to data migration while leasing or releasing resources. Moreover, we ident
 ify non-trivial interactions between scaling policies and graph workloads,
  which add an extra level of complexity to resource management and schedul
 ing for graph processing.
