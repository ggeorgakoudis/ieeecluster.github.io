    <b>COVID-19 Announcement</b><br><br>
    The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current
    COVID-19 situation, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of IEEE Cluster 2021
    into an all-digital conference experience – IEEE Cluster 2021 will now be an online event. <b>Therefore,
      IEEE Cluster 2021 will no longer take place in Portland, Oregon, USA and will instead take place
      virtually</b>. The conference dates remain the same – September 7-10, 2021. Proceedings will not be
    cancelled, and publications will continue as planned. For questions, contact the Virtual Arrangements
    Chairs.

    cluster systems for scientific and commercial applications. Cluster 2021 involves participants (researchers,
    developers, and users) from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce, coming together to discuss
    recent advances and trends in, but not limited to:</p>
