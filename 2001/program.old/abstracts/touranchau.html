    <td width="100%"> Cluster computing has clearly shown the necessity of high performance
      communication systems. Several high performance network vendors are competing with different approaches: all-in-harware vs.
      programmable interfaces.  Using the programmable Myrinet NICs we show that the
      performance limits of this approach are far better from the usual expectation when using optimized pipeline software design.
      Moreover, the ability to propose classical API like MPI with efficient protocols, partially embedded at the NIC level are very promising in
      terms of performances and communication/computation overlap.<br>
      <br>
      NIC communication system:<br>
      <br>
      The BIP, Basic Interface for Parallelism, developed at CNRS/ENS/INRIA/UCB in Lyon is a low-level communication system for
      Myrinet programmable network interface cards (NIC) which includes a dedicated firmware. We identified several flaws in the early design of
      our firmware and decided to rethink it in BIPng. Our first goal in BIPng was to better use the hardware resources and to ensure the best
      possible flows of data through the channel controlled by the firmware. This results in a new more flexible architecture based on an
      event-driven heart, optimized pipelining of communications and the possibility to use hardware communication channels asynchronously.
      On one hand BIP has proven that a very small latency and a very large throughput can be delivered. On another hand all-in-hardware NIC
      implementations, like Giganet or NICs that implement the Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI), demonstrate better performance for
      medium-sized messages. Our second goal was thus to study how the programmable NICs can compare with the hardware solutions for
      medium-sized messages. We built a very precise model of the pipeline behavior driven by the NIC program in order to identify the
      bottlenecks. The results show that the pipeline quality is critical. We then developed
      an adaptive strategy as in Duke's Trapeze system and introduced it in
      BIPng. Experiments show up to a two-fold gain over the previous results and thus reach performances above the
      hardware solutions!<br>
      <br>
      NIC-embedded MPI communication library:<br>
      <br>
      Commodity components and high speed interconnects allow to build fast and cheap parallel machines for MPI applications. Several research
      works already demonstrated that the raw performance of MPI ports on top of user level network interfaces are close to the network hardware
      specifications.  However, most of these implementations offer poor possibilities of communication/computation overlapping because the
      application thread on the host processor is also responsible of a large part of the protocol. Thus, application performances are limited
      by this intrinsic no-overlap. One solution to this problem is to move the critical
      part of the protocol at the programmable network interface card level. We implemented such a communication system that
      relies on the embedded processor of the Myrinet host interface. We present the
      problems that occurs while moving part of the protocol at the network interface level, then introduce our design choices and the
      resulting performance measurements of classical benchmarks with our MPI-BIPng prototype.</td>
