This tutorial is intended to provide an in-depth overview of the<br>
emerging InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) standard. This new<br>
architecture eliminates the PCI bus-based architecture and supports<br>
switched connections. It incorporates high performance I/O in<br>
addition to interprocessor communication, provides QoS and protection<br>
in the network, provides multiple transport services, and allows<br>
flexibility of IBA subnets to be connected to Wide Area Networks<br>
(WANs) through routers. The IBA standard incorporates many of the<br>
Virtual Interface Architecture (VIA) functions at its verbs layer.<br>
The tutorial will demonstrate how high performance communication and<br>
I/O architectures for clusters can be designed with this standard by<br>
taking into account interprocessor communication, network<br>
communication, and communication to I/O devices. The basic components<br>
of the IBA standard and multiple layers of this architecture will be<br>
described in detail. The new functionalities associated with this<br>
standard such as Quality of Service, Protection Domains, etc., for<br>
designing large-scale enterprise servers will be discussed. The<br>
interactions among these components and their interactions with the<br>
host, OS, Network-Interface Card (NIC), router/switch, and I/O devices<br>
to support low-latency and high bandwidth interprocessor communication<br>
and I/O will be analyzed. Open research challenges in designing<br>
scalable IBA implementations and providing support for higher-level<br>
programming models (such as distributed memory, distributed shared<br>
memory, and get/put ) on these systems will be outlined. The tutorial<br>
will conclude with an overview of on-going InfiniBand and VIA related<br>
research at universities, industry, and research labs.</p>
<p><i>Dhabaleswar K. Panda is a Professor of Computer Science at the Ohio<br>
State University. He obtained his Ph.D. in computer engineering from<br>
the University of Southern California. His research interests include<br>
parallel computer architecture, user-level communication protocols,<br>
interprocessor communication and synchronization, network-based<br>
computing, and high-performance computing. He has published over 90<br>
papers in major journals and international conferences related to<br>
these research areas. Dr. Panda and his research group members have<br>
been doing extensive research on VIA and InfiniBand. His research<br>
group has collaborated with IBM T.J. Watson in designing a high<br>
performance VIA implementation for the IBM Netfinity cluster system.<br>
His research group is currently collaborating with Intel and IBM on<br>
VIA and InfiniBand implementations.</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Panda has served on Program Committees and Organizing Committees<br>
of several parallel processing conferences. He was Program Co-Chair<br>
of the 1999 International Conference on Parallel Processing, founding<br>
Co-Chair of the 1997 and 1998 Workshops on Communication and<br>
Architectural Support for Network-Based Parallel Computing (CANPC),<br>
Co-Guest-Editor for two special issue volumes of Journal of Parallel<br>
and Distributed Computing on ``Workstation Clusters and Network-based<br>
Computing'', founding Co-Chair of International Workshop on<br>
Communication Architecture for Clusters (CAC '01). He also served as<br>
an IEEE Distinguished Visitor Speaker and an IEEE Chapters Tutorials<br>
Program Speaker during 1997-2000. Currently, he is serving as an<br>
Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed<br>
Computing, General Co-Chair of the 2001 International Conference on<br>
Parallel Processing, and Program Co-Chair of the 2002 Workshop on<br>
Communication Architecture for Clusters (CAC '02). Dr. Panda is a<br>
recipient of the NSF Faculty Early CAREER Development Award, the<br>
Lumley Research Award at Ohio State University (1997 and 2001), and an<br>
Ameritech Faculty Fellow Award. Dr. Panda is listed as a distinguished<br>
scientist in &quot;Who'sWho in America&quot; and in &quot;American Men &amp;
Women of<br>
