A parallel file system is normally used to support excessive file<br>
requests from parallel applications in a cluster system, whereas<br>
prefetching is useful for improving the file system performance. This<br>
paper proposes a table-comparison prefetching policy that is<br>
particularly suitable for parallel scientific applications and<br>
multimedia web services in a VIA-based parallel file system. VIA<br>
relieves the communication overhead of traditional communication<br>
protocols, such as TCP/IP. The proposed policy introduces a<br>
table-comparison method to predict data for prefetching. In addition,<br>
it includes an algorithm to determine whether and when the prefetching<br>
is performed using the current available I/O bandwidth. Experimental<br>
results confirmed that the use of the proposed prefetching policy in a<br>
VIA-based parallel file system produced a higher file system<br>
performance.</p>
