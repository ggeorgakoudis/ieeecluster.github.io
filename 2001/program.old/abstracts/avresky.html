<h1>Dynamic Reconfiguration in High-Speed Computer Clusters &nbsp;</h1>

Network component failures in high-speed local area networks or system<br>
area networks can result in significant topological changes. In such<br>
cases, a network reconfiguration algorithm is executed to restore the<br>
connectivity. Most of the current network reconfiguration protocols<br>
stop the user traffic to prevent cyclic dependencies in the routing<br>
tables.<br>
<br>
In this paper we specify NetRec, a novel dynamic reconfiguration<br>
algorithm designed to increase the network availability in the presence<br>
of faults. Unlike many other algorithms, NetRec is applicable for all<br>
high-speed computer networks and is compatible with all modern routing<br>
techniques, including wormhole routing system area networks.<br>
<br>
It updates the routing tables asynchronously and doesn't require any<br>
global knowledge about the network topology. Certain phases of NetRec<br>
execute in parallel, thus reducing the reconfiguration time. The papers<br>
provides examples of the algorithm operation and presents results from<br>
validation of the algorithm in a distributed network simulation<br>
testbed.</p>
