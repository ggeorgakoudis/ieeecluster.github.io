In this paper we present the results of analyzing different approaches<br>
to implementing dynamic allocation on a large space-shared Linux<br>
cluster using an actual historical workload. We take the approach that<br>
dynamic allocation of nodes to processes can be initiated by the<br>
application as opposed to the more commonly studied approach in which<br>
the operating system requests an application to change the number of<br>
nodes it is allocated. We take the stance that jobs requesting dynamic<br>
allocation should have a minimized impact on the rest of the system. We<br>
conclude that this occurs when dynamic allocation is implemented in a<br>
non-blocking, non-priority fashion. We give a proposal for an<br>
implementation of dynamic allocation under MPI-2 which is non-priority<br>
and gives the user the choice of blocking and non-blocking while<br>
waiting for additional nodes.</p>
