With the recent popularity of cluster computing, the demand for<br>
advanced system software for PC clusters has grown as well. Whereas<br>
some system software components, like message passing systems, have<br>
been in place for a long time, parallel file systems seem to just be<br>
coming to the forefront of attention.<br>
<br>
Parallel file systems provide high performance disk access, which is<br>
crucial for many scientific and commercial applications. In this paper,<br>
we evaluate the current state of the art of parallel file systems for<br>
PC clusters. To do so, we describe three parallel file systems and<br>
compare their performance. The three file systems are one open-source<br>
system, PVFS, for Linux clusters and two commercial systems, IBM GPFS<br>
and Intel PFS, for IBM SP and ASCI Red, respectively.<br>
<br>
Our study found many strengths, weaknesses and sensitivities of these<br>
parallel file systems. While there is still room for improvements, high<br>
performance disk access on PC clusters is becoming a reality. Parallel<br>
file systems for PC clusters have come a long way. Three and a half<br>
years after I/O throughputs of more than 1 Gigabyte/sec have been<br>
achieved for the first time (with Intel PFS on ASCI Red), PVFS can<br>
deliver this level of I/O performance on PC clusters.</p>
