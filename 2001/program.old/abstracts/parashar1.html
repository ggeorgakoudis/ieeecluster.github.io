Heterogeneous networked clusters are being increasingly used as<br>
platforms for resource-intensive parallel and distributed applications.<br>
The fundamental idea is to provide large amounts of processing capacity<br>
over extended periods of time by harnessing the idle and available<br>
resources on the network in an ?opportunistic? manner. In this paper we<br>
present the design, implementation and evaluation of a framework that<br>
uses JavaSpaces to support this type of adaptive parallel/distributed<br>
computing in a non-intrusive manner over networked clusters. The<br>
framework targets applications exhibiting coarse grained parallelism<br>
and has three key features: 1) portability across heterogeneous<br>
platforms, 2) minimized overheads for configuration of participating<br>
nodes, and 3) automated monitoring of system state (using SNMP) to<br>
ensure non-intrusive behavior.  Experimental results presented<br>
demonstrate that for applications that can be broken into manageable<br>
components, such an adaptive parallel computing framework can provide<br>
performance gains. Furthermore, the results show that monitoring and<br>
reacting to system state enables us to minimize intrusiveness to the<br>
machines in the cluster.</p>
