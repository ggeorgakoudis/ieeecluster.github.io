This paper presents a dynamic multi-application scheduling approach for<br>
running and scheduling parallel adaptive applications in Networks of<br>
Workstations (NOWs) and Clusters of Processors (COPs). Parallel<br>
adaptive applications have the property of varying their parallelism<br>
degree dynamically following availability of resources and changes in<br>
the underlying environment's state. In our model, each parallel<br>
adaptive application has its own scheduler responsible for optimizing<br>
resources which it uses. Multi-application scheduling consists of<br>
sharing resources among applications fairly and uses a combined<br>
(time-sharing and space-sharing) scheduling approach. The scheduling<br>
approach is characterized especially by dynamic arrivals of<br>
applications, remapping of allocation in order to handle dynamic<br>
arrivals and departures of applications and the underlying environment<br>
changes. Therefore, resources are fairly shared among applications. The<br>
multi-application scheduler interacts with application schedulers in<br>
order to optimize the scheduling approach. Application schedulers are<br>
responsible for applying multi-application scheduling decisions and<br>
optimizing internally resources exploited by the application.  Beyond<br>
the adaptive aspect which allows parallel applications to exploit idle<br>
cycles in NOWs with respect to the personal character of workstations,<br>
the proposed model provides a multi-application scheduling support<br>
which ensures better resource exploitation globally and fair resource<br>
sharing between parallel applications.</p>
