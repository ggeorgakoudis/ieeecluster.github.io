Since the first black monolith for cluster software appeared in the early&nbsp;<br>
90s, heralding networks of workstations as a parallel computing platform,&nbsp;<br>
software has been at the very core of the evolution of cluster&nbsp;<br>
computing.  From the very first job spawning mechanisms and TCP/IP-based&nbsp;<br>
message passing to today's batch schedulers and zero-copy message layers,&nbsp;<br>
how much has changed?<br>
<br>
What are the important challenges, and how are they being addressed?<br>
<br>
The distinguished panelists, all with a long history in cluster enabling&nbsp;<br>
software, will focus their discussions on several points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did we get here, and why has it taken so long?</li>
  <li>Has evolution stopped?    Are mass extinctions beginning?  What&nbsp;<br>
    technologies are doomed to be a anthropological footnote in cluster&nbsp;<br>
    computing history?</li>
  <li>What cluster software traits, concepts and implementations are most&nbsp;<br>
    successful. Why?</li>
  <li>Where does cluster software remain primitive and Neanderthal?  What are&nbsp;<br>
    the fundamentally hard problems?</li>
  <li>When, where, and why will the next black monolith appear?  When can we&nbsp;<br>
    expect a profound shift in capability for cluster software, matching the&nbsp;<br>
    impact of the transistor, Unix, or message passing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please join the panelists as they answer these questions and then discuss&nbsp;<br>
the successes and failures and new breakthroughs expected for cluster software.</p>
