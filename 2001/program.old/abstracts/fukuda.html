M++ self-migrating threads are C++ compiled objects, capable of<br>
constructing computational network and autonomously migrating<br>
themselves over a cluster system. The main goal of M++ is to provide a<br>
cluster computing paradigm for multi-agent simulation that has gained<br>
popularity in artificial life and ecological simulations, and<br>
biological modeling. This type of simulation usually requires<br>
autonomous objects, each having its own goals and behaviors, to<br>
interact with each other in a synthetic world. The M++ self-migrating<br>
threads match the characteristics of such objects in multi-agent<br>
simulation, and can thus describe them with narrower semantics gap.<br>
Fine granularity and large scalability are two fundamental<br>
characteristics of this type of simulations that require fast thread<br>
context switch and migration. With the scheduling policy we have<br>
designed, M++ manages its threads in pin-downed pages, so that<br>
Myrinet's network interface card can directly access and transfer those<br>
threads without unnecessary copying operations. In this paper, we<br>
present the M++ threads' programmability and study their performance<br>
using two multi-agent simulation programs: ant farm simulation and<br>
growing neural network.</p>
