<h1>Graph Partitioning for Dynamic, Adaptive and Multi-phase Scientific Simulations</h1>

<p>The efficient execution of scientific simulations on HPC systems requires<br>
a partitioning of the underlying mesh among the processors such that<br>
the load is balanced and the inter-processor communication is<br>
minimized.  Graph partitioning algorithms have been applied with much<br>
success for this purpose.  However, the parallelization of multi-phase<br>
and multi-physics computations poses new challenges that require<br>
fundamental advances in graph partitioning technology.  In addition,<br>
most existing graph partitioning algorithms are not suited for the<br>
newer heterogeneous high-performance computing platforms.  This talk<br>
will describe research efforts in our group that are focused on<br>
developing novel multi-constraint and multi-objective graph<br>
partitioning algorithms that can support the advancing state-of-the-art<br>
in numerical simulation technologies.  In addition, we will present our<br>
preliminary work on new partitioning algorithms that are well suited<br>
for heterogeneous architectures</p>
