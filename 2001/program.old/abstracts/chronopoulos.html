Distributed Computing Systems are a viable and less expensive<br>
alternative to parallel computers. However, a serious difficulty in<br>
concurrent programming of a distributed system is how to deal with<br>
scheduling and load balancing of such a system which may consist of<br>
heterogeneous computers. Distributed scheduling schemes suitable for<br>
parallel loops with independent iterations on heterogeneous computer<br>
clusters have been designed in the past.  In this work we consider a<br>
class of Self-Scheduling schemes for parallel loops with independent<br>
iterations which have been applied to multiprocessor systems. We extend<br>
this type of schemes to heterogeneous distributed systems.  We present<br>
tests that the distributed versions of these schemes maintain  load<br>
balanced execution on heterogeneous systems.</p>
