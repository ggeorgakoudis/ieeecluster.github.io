<h1>CPPvm - Parallel Programming in C++ &nbsp;</h1>

<p>CPPvm is a C++ class library for message passing.  It provides an<br>
easy-to-use C++ interface to the parallel virtual machine software<br>
PVM.<br>
<br>
CPPvm is available on many architectures, from Windows up to several<br>
UNIX derivatives.  Although PVM can be used directly in C++ programs<br>
due to its C-functions, it does not support C++ specific features.<br>
CPPvm enlarges PVM with these C++ features like classes, inheritance,<br>
overloaded operators, exception handling and streams. CPPvm also hides<br>
some details of PVM from the user and thus makes it even easier to<br>
write parallel programs.<br>
<br>
This paper describes the concept of CPPvm, the main classes, the<br>
transfer of C++ objects between processes, the use of distributed C++<br>
objects and how to combine a heterogenous collection of computers<br>
within CPPvm.  It will also focus on the extension of CPPvm with user<br>
defined classes. This allows, for example, to transform existing C++<br>
programs into parallel programs running on a computer cluster.</p>
