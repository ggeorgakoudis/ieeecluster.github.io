<h1>Advanced Cluster Programming with MPI&nbsp;</h1>

<p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides a powerful, scalable&nbsp;<br>
programming model that is especially well-suited to clusters.  The&nbsp;<br>
emergence of implementations of MPI-2, which provides many new features&nbsp;<br>
that extend the message-passing programming model, makes possible new&nbsp;<br>
applications and programming methods.  This tutorial discusses both the new&nbsp;<br>
features in MPI-2, such as dynamic process creation, remote-memory access,&nbsp;<br>
and parallel I/O, along with techniques to achieve high performance with&nbsp;<br>
MPI-1 on clusters.  Each of these is illustrated with a complete example&nbsp;<br>
program that discusses the use of MPI features in a cluster context.<br>

<i>William Gropp received his B.S. in Mathematics from Case Western Reserve&nbsp;<br>
University in 1977, a MS in Physics from the University of Washington in&nbsp;<br>
1978, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford in 1982.  He held the&nbsp;<br>
positions of assistant (1982-1988) and associate (1988-1990) professor in&nbsp;<br>
the Computer Science Department or Yale University.  In 1990, he joined the&nbsp;<br>
Numerical Analysis group at Argonne, where he is Associate Division&nbsp;<br>
Director and Senior Computer Scientist.  He also holds the position of&nbsp;<br>
Senior Scientist in the Computer Science Department at the University of&nbsp;<br>
Chicago, and Senior Fellow in the Computation Institute of Argonne National&nbsp;<br>
Laboratory and the University of Chicago.  His research interests are in&nbsp;<br>
parallel computing, software for scientific computing, and numerical&nbsp;<br>
methods for partial differential equations.   He is a co-author of the most&nbsp;<br>
widely used implementation of MPI, MPICH, and was involved in the MPI Forum&nbsp;<br>
as a chapter author for both MPI-1 and MPI-2.  He is one of the designers&nbsp;<br>
of the PETSc parallel numerical library, and has developed efficient&nbsp;<br>
parallel algorithms for the solution of linear equations.  He was a member&nbsp;<br>
of a team that was awarded a Gordon Bell Prize in 1999 for contributions in&nbsp;<br>
high performance computing.</i></p>
