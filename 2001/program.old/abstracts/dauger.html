At UCLA's Plasma Physics Group, we are successful in building and using<br>
a numerically-intensive parallel computing cluster using Power<br>
Macintosh hardware and the Macintosh Operating System.  This solution<br>
makes the problem of building and operating a parallel computer far<br>
easier than using other technologies, allowing the user, without<br>
expertise in the operating system, to efficiently develop and run<br>
parallel code.  This advantage enables the user to most effectively<br>
advance scientific research. This technology is robust in that it will<br>
run independent of great variations in the hardware and the operating<br>
system.  At the same time, by achieving over 20 Gigaflops on 16 400-MHz<br>
G4s, our team has proven the computational potential of the underlying<br>
PowerPC hardware.  The ongoing widespread deployment of OS X, a<br>
Unix-based Mac OS, will provide scientists access to the best tools of<br>
the Mac and Unix in one computing solution.  In the midst of this<br>
development, clustering Macs is poised to become a technology that will<br>
move parallel computing into the mainstream.  See<br>
