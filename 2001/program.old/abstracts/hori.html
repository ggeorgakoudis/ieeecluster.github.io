<h1>SCore: An Integrated Cluster System Software Package for&nbsp;<br>
High Performance Cluster Computing&nbsp;</h1>

<p>SCore Cluster System is an integrated software package for high<br>
performance clusters, and is used by worldwide users. SCore and the<br>
PMv2 high performance communication library, which supports various<br>
networks available today, was designed simultaneously. As a result,<br>
SCore can provide not only high performance cluster computing<br>
environment, but also a number of cluster programming facilities<br>
including Ethernet trunking, network interleaving, gang-scheduling,<br>
checkpoint and restart, real-time monitoring of user programs,<br>
deadlock detection, debugging support, etc.</p>
<p>SCore Cluster System Software is developed by the Real World<br>
Computing (RWC) Project funded by Japanese government. The RWC project<br>
will be terminated by the end of March, 2002, however, PC Cluster<br>
Consortium (http://www.pccluster.org) is formed and the<br>
development of SCore Cluster System Software is continued by the<br>
consortium.</p>
<p>In this talk, after the brief introduction of SCore Cluster System<br>
Software, target and the current status of the PC Cluster Consortium<br>
will be presented.</p>
