<h1>High Performance Computing with Microsoft Windows 2000 &nbsp;</h1>
<p><b>David Lifka <br>
Cornell Theory Center</b></p>
<p>The Cornell Theory Center has moved its entire<br>
computing infrastructure over to Dell Servers running<br>
Microsoft Windows 2000. This change has led to significant<br>
improvements in performance, reliability and TCO over the<br>
proprietary UNIX-based systems CTC operated in the past.<br>
We will provide an overview of the current CTC systems,<br>
examples of applications that have benefited, and discuss<br>
how reliability and TCO have been affected by high volume,<br>
industry standard hardware and software.</p>
