The Oasis+ distributed storage system is a reliable memory store for small scale computing clusters.  It is
implemented entirely in-memory using Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) and was built to operate as a backbone service
for a computing cluster that supports mobile workstations or remote clients needing fast access to storage.  The&nbsp;
system can store data quickly in a dependable manner in part by using a high-performance, high-availability page-based protocol called BR [1].  BR guarantees robust&nbsp;
functionality despite multiple site failures that could&nbsp; occur.  By integrating address range locking and eager
release consistency (ERC) [2] Oasis+ provides a flexible and efficient platform for the development of distributed&nbsp;
services.  Reliability is achieved by replication and&nbsp; corrective cleanup recovery actions once failures arise.</p>
