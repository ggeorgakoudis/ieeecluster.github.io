In this paper we report experiences on a parallel implementation of a<br>
standard cell placement algorithm on a cluster of myrinet connected<br>
PCs.  The proposed algorithm is based on a recently developed placement<br>
tool (called Feng Shui) that extends recursive bisection placement to<br>
incorporate global aspects of the design.  This is achieved using an<br>
efficient and novel optimization called iterative deletion.  We<br>
investigate several algorithmic and system-level optimizations.<br>
Contrary to previous attempts at parallelizing placement algorithms,<br>
initial experimental results show significant performance improvement<br>
with small reduction in the placement quality.  Furthermore, the<br>
reduction in the placement quality does not increase with the number of<br>
processors.</p>
