Cluster provides a viable approach to build a scalable Web server<br>
system. However, current Web server clusters do not fully utilize the<br>
underlying features of the cluster environment, and most parallel web<br>
servers are designed for homogeneous cluster. In this paper, we present<br>
a pure Java implemented parallel Web server with the aims to achieve<br>
good scalability, load balancing, as well as to run on heterogeneous<br>
clusters. An application- level global object space (GOS) is<br>
constructed to effectively utilize the available physical memory of the<br>
cluster as a giant object cache to shorten the object access time.<br>
Global object space also provides a unified view of cluster-wide<br>
resource allocation to help achieve better load balance. A cooperative<br>
object caching mechanism based on the concept of ¡°hot object¡± is<br>
built in the global object space for improving the whole system<br>
performance. A preliminary prototype system is implemented by modifying<br>
the W3C¡¯s Jigsaw Web server, and good speedup was gained in the<br>
benchmark tests. The hot object caching greatly improved the<br>
performance as compared with a Web server system without a<br>
cluster-aware object caching mechanism.</p>
