Nowadays PC-cluster architectures are widely accepted for parallel<br>
computing. In a PC-cluster system, memories are physically<br>
distributed.  To harness the computational power of a<br>
distributed-memory PC-cluster, a user must write efficient software for<br>
the machine by hand. The absence of global address space makes the<br>
process laborious because the user must manually assign computations to<br>
processors, distribute data across processors and explicitly manage<br>
communication among processors. This paper introduces our recent three<br>
related studies on parallel computing.  The first is a V-Bus based<br>
PC-cluster in which all PCs are interconnected through V-Bus network<br>
cards. The second is the implementation of an one-sided communication<br>
library on our PC-cluster system, which provides the user with a view<br>
of global address space on top of the distributed-memory PC-cluster.<br>
This encapsulation of global address allows the user to write shared<br>
memory code on our cluster system, which simplifies programming our<br>
cluster because the user does not need to explicitly cope with<br>
distributed memories. The third is a parallelizing compiler that<br>
automatically translates sequential code to shared-memory code for the<br>
PC-cluster. This compiler not only enables legacy code to be compiled<br>
for our cluster, but also further simplifies programming our cluster by<br>
allowing the user to continue using conventional sequential languages<br>
such as Fortran 77. In this work, the compiler was optimized<br>
particularly for our V-Bus based PC-cluster. The paper also reports our<br>
experimental results with the compiler on our PC-cluster system.</p>
