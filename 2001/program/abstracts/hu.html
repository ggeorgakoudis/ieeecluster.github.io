Most software DSMs use the interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify<br>
applications that messages have arrived. Interrupt, however, is<br>
expensive and may not be available in user-level communication<br>
protocols.  This paper studies the performance of software DSMs using<br>
threads instead of interrupt for communication. We implement three<br>
thread communication methods in the JIAJIA software DSM. The first<br>
method separates a communication thread from the main thread, the<br>
second method divides the communication thread into a sending thread<br>
and a receiving thread, and the third method further splits a serving<br>
thread from the receiving thread.<br>
<br>
The effect of the thread communication methods is evaluated in a PC<br>
cluster and a cluster of PowerPC workstations with some well-accepted<br>
benchmarks.  Evaluation results show that the performance of thread<br>
communication is slightly worse than that of interrupt communication in<br>
JIAJIA when there is only one processor to run a process, but is better<br>
than that of interrupt communication when there are more than one<br>
processors in a node to run a process. The thread communication method<br>
with one sending thread and one receiving thread achieves the best<br>
performance in the three thread communication methods. Besides, the<br>
effect of the thread communication in JIAJIA is also related to the<br>
operating system.<br>
<br>
Analysis of the evaluation results reveals that the waiting time<br>
constitutes the major overhead of the execution, and the dominant<br>
factor that influence waiting time is neither the interrupt overhead<br>
nor the thread switching overhead but the responsiveness of requests<br>
(i.e., whether requests can be processed and replied promptly).</p>
