<h1>NPACI Rocks: Tools and Techniques for Easily Deploying Manageable Linux Clusters&nbsp;</h1>

<br>
High-performance computing clusters (commodity hardware with<br>
low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects) based on Linux, are rapidly<br>
becoming the dominant computing platform for a wide range of scientific<br>
disciplines. Yet, straightforward software installation, maintenance,<br>
and health monitoring for large-scale clusters has been a consistent<br>
and nagging problem for non-cluster experts. The complexity of managing<br>
hardware heterogeneity, tracking security and bug fixes, insuring<br>
consistency of software across nodes, and orchestrating wholesale (or<br>
forklift) upgrades of Linux OS releases (every 6 months) often<br>
discourages would-be cluster users.<br>
<br>
The NPACI Rocks toolkit takes a fresh perspective on management and<br>
installation of clusters to dramatically simplify this software<br>
tracking. The basic notion is that complete (re)installation of OS<br>
images on every node is an easy function and the preferred mode of<br>
software management. The NPACI Rocks toolkit builds on this simple<br>
notion by leveraging existing single-node installation software (Red<br>
Hat's Kickstart), scalable services (e.g., NIS, HTTP), automation, and<br>
database-driven configuration management (MySQL) to make clusters<br>
approachable and maintainable by non-experts. The benefits include<br>
straightforward methods to derive user-defined distributions that<br>
facilitate testing and system development and methods to easily include<br>
the latest upgrades and security enhancements for production<br>
environments. Installation performance has good scaling properties with<br>
a complete reinstallation (from a single server) of a 32-node cluster<br>
taking only 30% longer than one node.<br>
<br>
The toolkit incorporates the latest Red Hat distribution (including<br>
security patches) with additional cluster-specific software.  Using the<br>
identical software tools that are used to create the base distribution,<br>
users can customize and localize Rocks for their site. This flexibility<br>
means that the software structure is dynamic enough to meet the needs<br>
of cluster-software developers, yet simple enough to allow non-experts<br>
to effectively manage clusters.  Rocks is a solid infrastructure and is<br>
extensible so that the community can adapt the software toolset to<br>
incorporate the latest functionality that defines a modern computing<br>
cluster. Strong adherence to widely-used (de facto) tools allows Rocks<br>
to move with the rapid pace of Linux development. Version 2.0 of the<br>
toolkit is available for download and installation. To date, 10<br>
clusters spread among 5 institutions have been built using this<br>
toolkit.</p>
