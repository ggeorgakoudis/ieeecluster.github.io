<h1>The Lightweight Protocol CLIC: Performance of an MPI implementation on CLIC&nbsp;</h1>

CLIC is a lightweight protocol that has recently been proposed for<br>
efficient communication in clusters using the Linux Operating System.<br>
Besides optimizing communication performance, by reducing the latencies<br>
and increasing the bandwidth figures even for short messages, the<br>
proposed communication layer also meets other requirements such as<br>
multiprogramming, portability, protection against corrupted programs,<br>
reliable message delivery, direct access to the network for all<br>
applications, etc. In this way, instead of removing the operating<br>
system kernel from the critical path and creating a user-level network<br>
interface, the operating system support has been optimized to provide<br>
reliable and efficient network software, avoiding the TCP/IP protocol<br>
stack.<br>
<br>
The LAM-MPI communication layer has been implemented on top of the<br>
proposed protocol and the communication performance has been tested in<br>
a cluster of PCs with Linux OS and interconnected with Fast Ethernet.<br>
The performance figures obtained define the best situation that can be<br>
attained without modifying the device drivers or using a user-level<br>
network interface approach.</p>
