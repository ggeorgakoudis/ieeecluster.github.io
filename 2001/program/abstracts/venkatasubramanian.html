With advances in storage technology, the ability to provide client end<br>
storage for continuous media applications has become a possibility.<br>
Transmission of data in cluster-based multimedia environments can be<br>
semi-continuous in conjunction with client side buffering and staging.<br>
Experiments indicate that a client buffer size (staging degree) of 20<br>
percent (of object size) is near optimal for most objects.  The work<br>
presented in this paper also addresses the implications of<br>
semi-continuous transmission to placement and admission control<br>
mechanisms in  a cluster-based multimedia server.  We improve admission<br>
control by introducing a technique called dynamic request migration in<br>
cluster-based multimedia servers that is enabled by client staging.<br>
Simulation studies demonstrate that close to maximum utilization can be<br>
achieved even if at most one migration within the server cluster is<br>
performed for each request arrival and each request is migrated at most<br>
once during its lifetime.  Furthermore, our performance results reveal<br>
that with client staging and dynamic request migration, even naive<br>
placement techniques are tolerant to extreme variations in request<br>
patterns.  In fact, our results indicate that under most circumstances<br>
one can be oblivious to request pattern variations during placement,<br>
eliminating the need to predict relative popularities of objects.</p>
