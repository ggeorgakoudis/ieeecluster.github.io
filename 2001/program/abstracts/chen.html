Given the increasing traffic on the World Wide Web (Web), it is<br>
difficult for a single popular Web server to handle the demand from its<br>
many clients.  By clustering a group of Web servers, it is possible to<br>
reduce the origin Web server's load significantly and reduce user's<br>
response time when accessing a Web document. A fundamental questions is<br>
how to allocate Web documents among these servers in order to achieve<br>
load balancing?<br>
<br>
In this paper, we are given a collection of documents to be stored on a<br>
cluster of Web servers. Each of the servers is associated with resource<br>
limits in their memory and their number of HTTP connections.  Each<br>
document has an associated size and access cost.  The problem is to<br>
allocate the documents among the servers so that no server's memory<br>
size is exceeded, and the load is balanced as equally as possible. In<br>
this paper, we present a number of approximation algorithms for<br>
allocating N documents among a group of Web servers in order to achieve<br>
load balance.k<br>
fault isolation as well as insight into complex system behavior.</p>
