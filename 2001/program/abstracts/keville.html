<h1>IEEE 1394 and RFC 2734: a Viable HSI for Hypercubes&nbsp;</h1>

<p>IEEE 1394 (FireWire) compliant cards and cables make for good, cheap<br>
cluster High Speed Interconnects (HSI) within some strict confines. Since<br>
much of the traditional network gear (switches, routers, etc.) is not<br>
available under IP-over-FireWire, this standard lends itself most to<br>
directly connected hypercubes and similar constructs. By virtue of the fact<br>
that you are restricted to this arrangement, though, you can make some<br>
network configuration refinements that ameliorate some of the shortcomings<br>
of this implementation. Many operating systems tuned for clustering already<br>
support an implementation of IP-over-FireWire, and most of these are coming<br>
into compliance with the applicable standards specifications, including RFC<br>
2734, IPv4 over IEEE 1394.<br>
