This paper presents a distributed object model MOIDE for solving<br>
irregularly structured problems on cluster. MOIDE is general-purpose<br>
and architecture-independent, for developing and executing irregular<br>
applications. The primary appeal of MOIDE is its flexible hierarchical<br>
collaborative system structure that is adaptive to heterogeneous<br>
architecture of a cluster. MOIDE integrates the object-oriented and<br>
multithreaded methodologies to set up a unified computing environment.<br>
Both the shared-data access and remote messaging are incorporated in a<br>
two-layer communication mechanism for efficient inter-object<br>
communication with the common communication interface.  MOIDE supports<br>
dynamic load balancing by its autonomous load scheduling technique. A<br>
runtime support system is developed in Java and RMI that implements<br>
MOIDE model as a platform-independent infrastructure to support<br>
efficient execution of irregularly structured applications on cluster.<br>
N-body, ray tracing, and conjugate gradient applications are developed<br>
to illustrate the advantages of MOIDE model in supporting the<br>
high-performance solutions for irregularly structured problems.</p>
