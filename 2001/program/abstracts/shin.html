The performance of a PC cluster system is limited by the use of<br>
traditional communication protocols, such as TCP/IP, because these<br>
protocols are accompanied with significant software overheads.  To<br>
overcome the problem, systems based on user-level interface for<br>
message-passing without intervention of kernel have been developed.<br>
VIA(Virtual Interface Architecture) is one of the representative<br>
user-level interfaces which provides low latency and high bandwidth.<br>
In this paper, a software VIA system is implemented on an 8-node<br>
SCI(Scalable Coherent Interface) network based PC cluster.  The system<br>
provides both message-passing and shared-memory programming<br>
environments and shows the maximum bandwidth of 84MB/s and the minimum<br>
latency of 8§Á in application level.  The maximum speed-up of 7.6 was<br>
obtained in executing the NAS parallel benchmark programs on the 8-node<br>
SCI-based PC cluster.  The system also shows better performance in<br>
comparison with other comparable cluster systems in carrying out the<br>
parallel benchmark programs.</p>
