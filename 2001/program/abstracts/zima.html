<h1><b>Towards High-Level Programming Support for Scientific Computing on Clust</b>ers&nbsp;</h1>

</b>Programming languages define the level of abstraction<br>
at which a user interacts with a machine. If target code&nbsp;<br>
 performance is essential (which is the case for most&nbsp;<br>
 scientific applications) then a compromise must be found<br>
between the advantages of high-level programming such<br>
as enhanced expressivity, verifiability and portability, and&nbsp;<br>
 the performance achievable by the explicit exploitation of&nbsp;<br>
 architectural properties offered by a low-level notation.&nbsp;<br>
 Scientific applications for clusters have been traditionally&nbsp;<br>
 parallelized using a combination of a traditional sequential&nbsp;<br>
 programming language such as Fortran or C/C++ with&nbsp;<br>
 low-level libraries (such as PVM or MPI) allowing virtually&nbsp;<br>
 complete control over the structure and degree of parallelism<br>
as well as the distribution and alignment of data across the&nbsp;<br>
 architecture. Program development for performance-critical&nbsp;<br>
 applications on clusters of SMPs has often gone a step further&nbsp;<br>
 by adopting two paradigms (such as OpenMP and MPI) in&nbsp;<br>
order to fully exploit the specific characteristics of parallelism<br>
at each level of the hybrid architecture.<br>
<br>
In this talk we will discuss recent developments oriented towards<br>
providing the programmer of scientific applications for clusters with<br>
a higher level of abstraction while maintaining the goal of exploiting&nbsp;<br>
 performance to the best possible degree. We will particularly focus<br>
on the requirements of irregular, dynamic and adaptive applications,&nbsp;<br>
 and discuss issues related to an integrated program development&nbsp;<br>
 supporting adaptive restructuring of programs and data.<br>
<br>
The talk will also provide a short overview of a number of key&nbsp;<br>
 installations of clusters in Europe and discuss related application<br>
domains and research activities.</p>
