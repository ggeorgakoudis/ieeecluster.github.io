<h1> Recent Advances in Cluster Networks&nbsp;</h1>

    <td width="100%">One of the significant advances in cluster networks over
      the past two years is that it is now practical to connect up to tens of
      thousands of hosts with networks that have enormous and scalable total
      capacity, and in which the communication from a host to any other host has
      the same cost. This same-cost property is desirable because it allows
      computing processes to be assigned to hosts according to
      cluster-management or load-balancing considerations, and without regard
      for the mapping of the communication patterns of the computation to the
      network topology.
      <p>The way in which this advance was accomplished is an elegant blend of
      theory and technology.</p>
      <p>It is no great trick to connect any number of hosts with a topology
      such as a mesh or torus. If you examine the capacity of such networks
      under arbitrary traffic patterns, and for larger and larger networks, you
      will notice that the number of internal communication links does not grow
      with the number of hosts. This internal capacity can be formalized in
      terms of the minimal number of communication links cut by any line that
      bisects the hosts. This metric is called the minimal bisection.</p>
      <p>For the scalable Clos networks that Myricom supplies, the minimal
      bisection is as large as possible, considering that host links may also be
      included in the cuts of the network. Hence, a Clos network is said to have
      &quot;full bisection.&quot; The Clos network, first described by Charles
      Clos in a paper published in 1954, has several other properties that make
      the Clos topology ideal for a cluster network.</p>
      <p>With this theoretical understanding of Clos networks, how do we make
      them practical? Clos networks require a lot of switches, and a lot of
      switch-to-switch communication links. For example, a 1024-host Clos
      network requires 320 16-port switches, with 80% of the switch ports
      connecting to another switch, and only 20% connecting to hosts.</p>
      <p>The simple answer to this question is to start with inexpensive
      switches, ideally single-chip switches, and to package them in a way that
      provides most or all of the switch-to-switch links on an inexpensive
      wiring medium -- circuit-board traces, not cables.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are open research problems. In order to reach the
      ideal of a network that handles all traffic patterns equally well, one can
      take advantage of another property of the Clos network. The Clos topology
      provides multiple routes between hosts, and all shortest routes are
      deadlock-free. When a host interface can send successive packets to
      another host along multiple routes, the traffic is dispersed in a way that
      statistically avoids &quot;hot spots,&quot; high utilization of specific
      network links that can result from single-route mappings of the
      communication patterns of application programs to the topology. This same
      dispersive routing technique can provide fault tolerance on a much smaller
      time scale than by periodic mapping, and can exploit multiple ports on
      host interfaces. There may be one or two excellent Ph.D.-thesis topics
      lurking here.</p>
