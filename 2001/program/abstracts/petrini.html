Using multiple independent networks (also known as rails) is an<br>
emerging technique to overcome bandwidth limitations and enhance<br>
fault-tolerance of current high-performance clusters. We present and<br>
analyze various venues for exploiting multiple rails. Different rail<br>
access policies are presented and compared, including static and<br>
dynamic allocation schemes.  An analytical lower bound on the number of<br>
networks required for static rail allocation is shown. We also present<br>
an extensive experimental comparison of the behavior of various<br>
allocation schemes in terms of bandwidth and latency.  Striping<br>
messages over multiple rails can substantially reduce network latency,<br>
depending on average message size, network load and allocation scheme.<br>
The methods compared include a static rail allocation, a round-robin<br>
rail allocation, a dynamic allocation based on local knowledge, and a<br>
rail allocation that reserves both end-points of a message before<br>
sending it. The latter is shown to perform better than other methods at<br>
higher loads: up to 49% better than local-knowledge allocation and 37%<br>
better than the round-robin allocation. This allocation scheme also<br>
shows lower latency and it saturates on higher loads (for messages<br>
large enough). Most importantly, this proposed allocation scheme scales<br>
well with the number of rails and message sizes.</p>
