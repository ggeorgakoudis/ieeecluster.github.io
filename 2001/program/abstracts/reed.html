    <td width="100%">Commodity processors and storage (embodied in clusters),
      very high-performance WAN and LAN interconnects, Linux and open source HPC
      and Grid software are transforming the way we develop and deploy
      high-performance computing resources. Concurrently, a new model of
      nationally integrated, tightly coupled scientific data archives and
      instruments is emerging. This talk outlines a new worldview of distributed
      data, computing, and network resources for 21st century science and
      engineering. It concludes with a look at the future of cluster computing
      and some thoughts on the five and ten year futures.</td>
