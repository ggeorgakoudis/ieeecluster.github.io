<h1><a href="oberlin.html"> Architecture Recapitulates Phylogeny: How Scalability Requires Specialization</a></h1>

<br>
There is an old saying in biology asserting that<br>
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, expressing the belief<br>
that the stages of development of an embryo, from one<br>
fertilized cell to a complete human form, mimics the steps<br>
taken by our genetic ancestors as homo sapiens evolved.<br>
There's an analogy that can be drawn between this<br>
biological assertion and the evolution of parallel<br>
processing.<br>
<br>
SMPs and clusters alike have generally been<br>
configured with nearly homogeneous functionality among<br>
processors.  This has limited their scalability for many<br>
large applications.<br>
<br>
Recently, more specialization of purpose has crept<br>
into the roles individual nodes play in cluster<br>
configurations.  As clusters are scaled further to take<br>
their place as the heirs to the roles formerly played by<br>
custom-designed large-scale supercomputers, even more<br>
specialization is needed to achieve the efficiency and<br>
manageability required to perform satisfactorily on<br>
tough capability workloads in demanding production<br>
environments, in the same way cells must differentiate<br>
and specialize in larger complex organisms.<br>
<br>
This talk will focus on the rise of clusters for high-<br>
performance capability computing.  It will examine the<br>
forces driving natural selection in today s changing<br>
high-performance computing environment, review the<br>
architectural genetics of successful and unsuccessful<br>
precursors to today's clustered HPC platforms,and look<br>
ahead to what adaptations may be needed for clusters to<br>
successfully occupy this challenging ecological niche.</p>
