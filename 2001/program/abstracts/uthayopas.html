<p>Beowulf cluster has created a lot of impact by delivering an excellent<br>
price/performance and scalable computing systems to high performance computing<br>
community.  Nevertheless, the widespread use of beowulf clusters has not<br>
happened as fast as it should be.  One of the major problem is that the software<br>
tools on beowulf system is still in a very primitive state.  Therefore, it is<br>
difficult for a small research group consisting of mainly non-computer<br>
scientists to build and maintain the cluster for their use.  In this paper, many<br>
factors that contribute to the problem has been identified especially the<br>
unnescessary complexity tat were build into the software.  Some of the solutions<br>
to this problem have been proposed.</p>
