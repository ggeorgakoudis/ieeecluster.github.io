<p>One benefit of cluster computer architectures is the opportunity for<br>
large I/O bandwidths.  High performance applications that require<br>
significant I/O throughput are increasingly of interest to the cluster<br>
computing community.  Parallel file systems are critical system software<br>
components that allow parallel applications to take advantage of the<br>
parallel I/O disk subsystems in a cluster architecture.  The Parallel<br>
Virtual File System (PVFS) was the first parallel file system developed<br>
specifically for cluster architectures and today is a popular choice<br>
for fast disk access.  This tutorial introduces the basic concepts<br>
behind parallel file systems and specific information about PVFS.<br>
The emphasis is on using PVFS to implement effective applications that<br>
require substantial I/O performance.  Topics include fundamental concepts,<br>
PVFS specifics, I/O interfaces including MPI-IO, example applications,<br>
performance tuning, and the future of PVFS.<br>

Electrical and Computer Engineering at Clemson University.  His research<br>
interests are in high performance computing, focusing on parallel file<br>
systems, problem solving environments, and reconfigurable computing.<br>
Current projects include the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS), Clemson<br>
Environment for Remote Sensing (CERSe), and the Reconfigurable Computing<br>
Application Development Environment (RCADE).<br>

Dr. Ross is a postdoctoral researcher in the Mathematics and Computer<br>
Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.  His research interests<br>
are in message passing and storage systems for high performance<br>
computing environments, in particular cluster computing environments.<br>
Current projects include the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS), the<br>
ROMIO MPI-IO implementation, and the MPICH implementation of the MPI<br>
message passing interface.</i></p>
