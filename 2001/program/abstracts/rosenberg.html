<h1>Sharing Partitionable Workloads in Heterogeneous NOWs: Greedier Is Not Better&nbsp;</h1>

Protocols are crafted for solving two problems related to sharing a<br>
large partitionable workload in a heterogeneous network of workstations<br>
(NOW) N.  In the NOW-Rental Problem, one must complete W units of work<br>
and wishes to ``rent'' N for as short a time as is necessary to<br>
complete that work.  In the NOW-Exploitation Problem, one has access to<br>
N for a fixed duration of L time units and wishes to accomplish as much<br>
work as possible during that time.  The worksharing protocols are<br>
crafted in the context of an architectural model that characterizes a<br>
heterogeneous NOW via a suite of parameters that measure the NOW's<br>
workstations' computational and communicational efficiencies; hence,<br>
the solutions produced are robust across a broad range of actual<br>
architectures.  The protocols determine both an amount of work to<br>
allocate to each of N's workstations and a schedule for transmitting<br>
that work; hence, the protocols are self-scheduling.  The schedules<br>
provide either a value for L, given W, or a value of W, given L,<br>
thereby solving both of the motivating problems.  By studying two<br>
specific protocols, it is proved analytically that, over sufficiently<br>
long worksharing opportunities, the intuitive strategy of supplying as<br>
much work as possible to faster workstations is not optimal.  It is<br>
then shown via simulations that this nonoptimality is often discernible<br>
in worksharing opportunities of less than a minute's duration.</p>
