<h1>Next Generation Parallel Virtual File System</h1>

<br>
The Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) is system software developed<br>
specifically for Beowulf class parallel computers that provides<br>
facilities for distributing file data among the nodes of the computer<br>
and for accessing the file data from the multiple tasks of a parallel<br>
application.</p>
<p>PVFS has been released and supported under a GPL license since 1998.<br>
We are currently undertaking a major rewrite of PVFS to<br>
include several new features and a new internal architecture.<br>
The goals of the new file system are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieve maximum performance for large scale parallel file I/O.</li>
  <li>Provide flexibility in network transfer, requests, data</li>
  <li>distribution, and data replication.</li>
  <li>Allow for the development of experimental file system features.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this talk we outline the future of PVFS and the major issues<br>
addressed by the new version. The new developments in PVFS can be&nbsp;<br>
 outlined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Requests based on MPI Datatypes,</li>
  <li>Programmable distributions,</li>
  <li>Support for data replication,</li>
  <li>Modular metadata subsystem,</li>
  <li>Multiple network transport methods,</li>
  <li>VFS-like system interface.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
