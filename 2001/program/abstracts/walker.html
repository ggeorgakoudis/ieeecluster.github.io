    <td width="100%">The Grid has been described as a distributed computing
      infrastructure for &quot;coordinated resource sharing and problem solving
      in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations&quot;. A virtual
      organization (VO) is a set of individuals and/or institutions with some
      common purpose or interest and that need to share their resources to
      further their objectives. These resources are typically computers, data,
      software, expertise, sensors, and instruments. A problem-solving
      environment (PSE) has been defined as &quot;a computer system that
      provides all the computational facilities necessary to solve a target
      class of problems&quot;. For large-scale, complex, multi-disciplinary
      problems these facilities are usually distributed and owned by different
      collaborating organizations. Thus, for a significant class of problems a
      PSE can be viewed as the environment through which the end-users in a VO
      exploit Grid resources. In general, PSEs are accessed through a web
      interface and are thus very similar to &quot;application portals.&quot;
      PSEs can be used for collaborative computational science and engineering
      and tele-science applications. A good example is the Cactus open source
      PSE that has been developed by an international collaboration of
      physicists and computational scientists to perform astrophysical
      simulations. The need for PSEs to support collaboration in distributed
      environments is widely recognized; however, these aspects introduce new
      types of complexity to the problem-solving process. In particular,
      end-users should not need to learn about generic middleware such as Globus
      to use a PSE. This talk will examine how &quot;intelligence&quot; in PSEs
      can deal with this complexity and help end-users in VOs make effective use
      of Grid resources.</td>
