Software latency has often been a problem in gigabit networking, since<br>
it makes the whole communication rather slow even on fast hardware.<br>
Previous work, such as BIP, try to solve the problem by sacrifying<br>
other aspects such as security. This article presents PAPI, a new<br>
software interface aimed at security study on HSL, a gigabit-class<br>
network. The basic version shows performance at least equivalent to the<br>
best software interfaces available today.  Finer analysis shows that<br>
hardware is now the limiting factor: software latency is no longer the<br>
problem in communications.</p>
