<h1>A Low-Cost, High-Density Mounting System for Computer Clusters</h1>

As the number of the processing units in a cluster computing system<br>
increases, what once were inconsequential details become major<br>
engineering concerns. Space, power distribution, and heat dissipation<br>
each demand attention for such clusters. We describe a simple rack<br>
mounting system that is serves as a low-cost solution for clusters with<br>
fifty or more machines. Four motherboards of the same form factor are<br>
stacked together with threaded rods and spacers and hang from<br>
inexpensive shelf brackets. This approach has enabled us to mount<br>
forty-eight motherboards and additional support hardware on a 6.5ft<br>
mobile rack with a 27in x 32in footprint for a fraction of the cost of<br>
traditional computer rack equipment or standard cases. In addition, the<br>
sharing of power supplies by eight motherboards has dramatically<br>
reduced complexity of our cluster. Efficient heat dissipation is<br>
demonstrated by thermal imaging.</p>
