<h1>Scalable Cluster Computing - Opportunities and Challenges</h1>
<p><b>William Camp<br>

</a><b>Sandia National Laboratories</b></p>
<p> Cluster computing would appear to offer a viable alternative to<br>
 current supercomputing offerings from vendors. In fact, several major<br>
 institutions have adopted scalable clusters either as mainline<br>
 computing platforms, as capacity engines, or as risk-reducing<br>
 alternatives to vendor-supplied solutions. I will discuss the<br>
 successes and shortcomings of cluster efforts to date in the field of<br>
 High Performance Supercomputing. In particular I will review one<br>
 major effort built initially on Compaq Alpha processors, Myrinet<br>
 interconnect hardware, Linux and custom communications, libraries and<br>
 system integration and management software. This project, Cplant, at<br>
 Sandia National Laboratories has created a virtual supercomputing<br>
 environment that nearly duplicates the look, feel and stability of a<br>
 massively parallel supercomputer such as Intel's ASCI TFlops and<br>
 Cray's T3E machines. Cplant has been released under GNU public<br>
 license and has been downloaded by nearly 1000 sies as of 8/1/01.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
 In this talk I will concentrate on what makes a "good" supercomputer<br>
 for engineering and scientific applications and evaluate the current<br>
 state and outlook for scalable clusters as a competitive approach for<br>
scalable supercomputing. This will be done largely in the context of<br>
 the Cplant initiative. Finally I will mention some successes with<br>
 scalable clustering in other areas such as bio-informatics and<br>
 visualization of terascale and petascale datasets.</p>
