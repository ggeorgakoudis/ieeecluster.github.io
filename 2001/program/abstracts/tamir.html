Cluster management middleware schedules tasks, controls<br>
access to shared resources, provides for task submission and<br>
monitoring, and coordinates the  cluster's  fault  tolerance<br>
mechanisms.   Thus,  reliable  continuous  operation  of the<br>
management  middleware  in  the  presence  of  faults  is  a<br>
prerequisite  to  the reliable operation of the cluster.  We<br>
present design considerations and implementation details  of<br>
cluster  mangement middleware for high performance computing<br>
in space, where fault rates are  significantly  higher  than<br>
for  earth-bound  systems.  We describe detection, recovery,<br>
and reconfiguration mechanisms for  key  system  components.<br>
The  system is based on centralized decision making.  Unlike<br>
most  other  systems,  the  decision  making  capability  is<br>
protected    by    active   replication   that   facilitates<br>
uninterrupted operation  and  the  ability  to  restore  the<br>
decision  maker  to  full  operational  and  fault tolerance<br>
capabilities  following  node   failure.    The   management<br>
middleware  is used to provide the application tasks with an<br>
out-of-band signaling capability that can be a key  building<br>
block for application-level fault tolerance mechanisms.  The<br>
middleware described has been implemented  as  part  of  the<br>
UCLA  Fault-Tolerant  Cluster Testbed (FTCT) project.  Based<br>
on  measurements  of   this   implementation,   we   present<br>
preliminary  evaluation  of  the  overheads  incurred by the<br>
management middleware.</p>
