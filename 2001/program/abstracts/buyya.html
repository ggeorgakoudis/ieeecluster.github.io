    <td width="100%">The growing popularity of the Internet along with the
      availability of powerful computers and high-speed networks as low-cost
      commodity components is changing the way we do computing. The emergence of
      two computing paradigms, &quot;cluster computing&quot; and &quot;global
      computing&quot; (Grid computing), is making developers rethink the way
      they design and implement their applications. The emerging technologies
      are enabling the coupling of a wide variety of geographically distributed
      resources such as desktop computers, clusters, storage systems and
      scientific instruments, and allowing them to be used as a single unified
      resource and thus forms what is popularly known as a Grid. In this
      tutorial we raise a number of open issues that the Grid community of
      researchers and developers need to address. Special emphasis will be
      placed on create a Grid of clusters-computing on multiple clusters
      geographically distributed across the campus, nation, or world.
      <p>We first discuss a number of social and architectural issues that are
      guiding the design of the next generation of Internet technologies and
      applications. We then describe some major international efforts in
      developing self-organising Grid software systems and applications both in
      academic, research and commercial settings. We then go onto to present
      some economics issues in Grid computing that are being developed, as well
      as the results of some experiments on wide-area high-throughput computing
      across the Internet. We conclude the tutorial by highlighting sociological
      and intellectual implications of this new Internet computing paradigm and
      its impact on the marketplace.</p>
      <p><i>Rajkumar Buyya is a Research Scholar at the School of Computer
      Science and Software Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.
      He was awarded Dharma Ratnakara Memorial Trust Gold Medal for his academic
      excellence during 1992 by Kuvempu/Mysore University. He is co-author of
      books: Mastering C++ and Microprocessor x86 Programming; and recently, he
      has edited a two volume book on High Performance Cluster Computing:
      Architectures and Systems (Vol. 1); Programming and Application (Vol.2)
      published by Prentice Hall, USA. He served as Guest Editor for the special
      issues of international journals: Parallel and Distributed Computing
      Practices, Informatica: An International Journal of Computing and
      Informatics, and Journal of Supercomputing.</i></p>
      <p><i>Rajkumar is a speaker in the IEEE Computer Society Chapter Tutorials
      Program. Along with Mark Baker, he co-chairs the IEEE Computer Society
      Task Force on Cluster Computing. He has contrbuted to the development of
      HPCC system software environment for PARAM supercomputer developed by the
      Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, India.</i></p>
      <p><i>Rajkumar conducted tutorials on advanced technologies such as
      Parallel, Distributed and Multithreaded Computing, Client/Server
      Computing, Internet and Java, Cluster Computing, and Java and High
      Performance Computing at international conferences. He has organised/chaired
      workshops, symposiums, and conferences at the international level in the
      areas of Cluster Computing and Grid Computing. He also serves as a
      reporter for Asian Technology Information Program, Japan/USA. His research
      papers have appeared in international conferences and journals. His
      research interests include Programming Paradigms and Operating
      Environments for Parallel and Distributed Computing.</i></p>
      <p><i>Mark Baker started working in the field of High Performance
      Computing at Edinburgh University (UK) in 1988. In Edinburgh he was
      involved in the development of parallel linear solvers on a large
      Transputer-systems using Occam. From 1990 until 1995 Mark was a project
      leader of a group at the University of Southampton (UK). This group was
      involved in developing and supporting environments and tools for a range
      of parallel and distributed systems. It was whilst at Southampton that
      Mark started to actively investigate and research software for managing
      and monitoring distributed environments. In 1995 Mark took up a post as
      Senior Research Scientist at NPAC, Syracuse University (USA). Whilst at
      NPAC Mark researched and wrote the widely sited critical review of the
      Cluster Management Systems. At Syracuse Mark worked on a range of projects
      involving the major HPC groups and Labs. in the US. It was during this
      period that he worked closely with Prof. Geoffrey Fox on a variety of
      cluster and metacomputing related projects.</i></p>
      <p><i>Since 1996, Mark has been a Senior Lecturer in the Division of
      Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth. At Portsmouth Mark
      lectures on network architectures, client/server programming and open
      distributed systems. Mark's current research is focused on the development
      of tools and services for PC-based distributed systems. Mark also tracks
      international metacomputing efforts and is involved with Java Grande and
      the definition of a Java interface to MPI.</i></p>
      <p><i>Mark has written a number of articles and papers on Cluster and Grid
      Computing. Mark is co-chair of the IEEE Computer Society Task Force on
      Cluster Computing (TFCC) and is currently a visiting Senior Research
      Scientist at Oak Ridge National Lab., USA.</i></p>
      <p><i>Mark is on the international editorial board of the Wiley Journal,
      Computation and Concurrency: Practice and Experience and regularly reviews
      papers for many journals in his field, including IEEE Computer and
      Internet Computing. Mark is the editor of the Grid Computing section of
      the IEEE CS on-line magazine DS-Online. Mark has given conference
      tutorials at HPDC (1999 and 2000), EuroPar 2000, Cluster2000 and SC2000. A
      full list of Mark's recent tutorials can be found at http://www.dcs.port.ac.uk/~mab/Tutorials/</i></p>
