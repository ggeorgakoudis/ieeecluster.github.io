<h1>Design and Implementation of High Available Linux Clusters</h1>
<p><b>Ibrahim Haddad<br>

Ericsson Research, Canada</b></p>
<p>Fueled by the Internet revolution and the lure of opportunities in the new
converging world of<br>
voice, data and video over cost-effective networks, telecom and networking
companies are<br>
attempting to offer the most complete and compelling end-to-end enterprise
solutions.<br>
The interest in clustering from the telecom world comes from the fact that we
can address the<br>
availability and scaled performance using cost-effective hardware and software
while maintaining<br>
near telecom-grade characteristics. These characteristics include continuous
service availability,<br>
high reliability, superior performance, high throughput for fast and reliable
data streaming,<br>
flexibility in terms of fast reconfiguration, linear scalability, and ease and
completeness of<br>
management.</p>
<p>In 2000, the ARIES (Advanced Research on Internet E-Servers) project started
at Ericsson<br>
Research Canada, aimed at finding and prototyping the necessary technology to
prove the<br>
feasibility of a clustered Internet Server that provides telecom-grade
characteristics. In 2001,<br>
ARIES evolved into a new direction to enhance the clustering capabilities Linux
to fulfill the<br>
future demands for Mobile Internet Servers.<br>
This tutorial will address in detail all the design and implementation issues we
faced building<br>
Linux clusters using Linux and Open Source Software as the base technology; in
addition it will<br>
provide a how-to for building Linux clusters starting from scratch.</p>
<p><i>Ibrahim Haddad is a System Designer at the Ericsson Research Open
Architecture Lab<br>
in Montreal, Canada where he is primarily involved in researching carrier-class
server<br>
nodes for real-time all-IP networks. The focus of his work at Ericsson is to
bring telecom<br>
grade characteristics to Linux so that it can be considered as a potential
operating system<br>
for carrier-class servers. Ibrahim received his Bachelor and Masters degrees in
Computer&nbsp;<br>
Science from the Lebanese American University and he is currently a Dr.Sc.
Candidate at&nbsp;<br>
Concordia University. Ibrahim is also involved in several Open Source projects
and is a regular<br>
contributor to the Linux Journal.</i></p>
<p><i>Frederic Rossi is a System Designer at the Ericsson Research Open
Architecture Lab in<br>
Montreal, Canada where he is researching new load balancing and traffic
distribution<br>
algorithms to improve Linux capabilities to be considered as a platform of
choice for<br>
telecom grade clusters.<br>
Frederic received his Bachelor and Masters degrees in Computer Science from the<br>
University of Paris VIII.</i></p>
