      conference banquet on Wednesday<br>
      night will be held on the<a href="http://www.queenmary.com/"> Queen Mary</a>.<a name="QueenMary"></a>
      <p align="justify">The Queen Mary, the grandest ocean liner ever built,
      has played many roles in her illustrious career. During her heyday, many
      considered her the only civilized way to travel.</p>
      <p align="justify">With the outbreak of World War II, the Queen Mary was
      transformed into a troopship overnight. By the end of the war, &quot;The
      Grey Ghost,&quot; as she was fondly called, had carried more than 800,000
      troops, traveled more than 600,000 miles and played a significant role in
      virtually every major Allied campaign. In February 1946 she began her
      &quot;Bride and Baby Voyages&quot; and transported more than 22,000 war
      brides and their children to the United States and Canada. She even set a
      standing record for the most passengers carried in one crossing - more
      than 16,000 troops and crew!</p>
      <p align="justify">After the war, the Queen Mary resumed her elegant
      status. However, as air travel became increasingly more safe and
      affordable, the days of the transatlantic voyages were numbered. In 1967,
      the Queen Mary sailed from Southampton, England, to her new permanent home
      in Long Beach, California. It would be her last crossing - the end of an
      era.</p>
      <p align="justify">Today, the Queen Mary is an internationally recognized
      icon for the City of Long Beach, California. She is embraced as an
      historic hotel and a floating museum and is listed on the National
      Register of Historic Places.</td>
