<b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="left">Since this was the first time that a formal Industrial Exhibition
was held with the IEEE Cluster Conference, the General Co-Chairs wanted
to express our appreciation of companies who chose to exhibit not knowing
how large the meeting would be.&nbsp; Without a doubt, many interesting
new products were introduced at the conference.&nbsp; In essence, we wanted
to identify exhibitors that brought more than just technical excellence
and a recently introduced product to the conference, but also something
else, which we thought unique in a light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek manner.
<p align="left"><b>Selection Process</b>
<p align="left">The selection process was informal.&nbsp; The General Co-Chairs appointed
a small (5) committee drawn from the attendees (with no commercial connections)
to survey those that exhibited interesting or novel new products, one in
hardware and one in software.&nbsp; The award process was not meant to
be exhaustive, nor an official endorsement, but merely point out an interesting
and innovative product, worth a second look, and above all fun.
