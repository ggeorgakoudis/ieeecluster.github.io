	  <p>
	  As a main cultural event for the conference we will leave Chemnitz
	  and make a small trip to a town nearby: Annaberg-Buchholz (we will 
	  call it just Annaberg).
	  <p>
	  Annaberg is located in the center of the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) 
	  and has a very important historical meaning for the region.<br>
	  Just visit the web pages of <a href="http://www.annaberg-buchholz.de/start.htm">
	  Annaberg-Buchholz</a> and become more familar with it (there are 
          also small guided tours in English and French language).
	  <p>
	  We will go by bus to Annaberg on thursday afternoon.  
	  Then you will have the opportunity to visit several places
	  in the town. Maybe the most interesting one for our guild is
	  the Adam-Ries-Museum.<br>
	  For those that are interested and don't have agoraphobia
	  there will be a trip to "Down Under" - not to Australia, 
	  but into a mine underneath the surface of Annaberg where
	  ore was mined and lifted up that time.
	  <p>
	  The evening will be concluded by a rich dinner in a restaurant there.
	  After that the busses will take us back to Chemnitz.
	  <p>
	  <p>
          We are happy that we could rise additional funding for the 
	  conference and one of our conference sponsors - 
          Alpha Processor, Inc. (now API NetWorks) supports this event kindly.
          So we can offer this nice cultural event for free for everybody.
	  Therefore we kindly invite you to join this event because you 
	  will get a great impression about the region and its historical
	  meaning.
