	<td><b>Biography</b>
	    <p>
	    <a href="mailto:tron@cacr.caltech.edu">Dr. Thomas Sterling</a> 
	    is a Principal Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion
	    Laboratory and a Faculty Associate at the California Institute of
	    Technology. The Principal Investigator on the HTMT architecture project,
	    he leads a team of over a dozen institutions in an in-depth exploration
	    of an innovative approach to achieving Petaflops-scale computing by
	    integrating advanced technologies in a dynamic adaptive latency
	    management structure. Sterling is also engaged in the development of
	    advanced Processor-in-Memory execution models, and the invention of
	    Continuum Computer Architecture, a general purpose cellular architecture
	    approach to ultra-scale computing. A graduate of MIT (Ph.D, 1984) and
	    Hertz Fellow, Dr. Sterling has engaged in research studies in parallel
	    computing systems architecture and software over the last two decades.
	    He is best known for his development (with colleague Don Becker) of
	    Beowulf-class PC cluster computing when at the NASA Goddard Space Flight
	    Center and as a leader of the National Petaflops Initiative while at
	    Caltech and JPL. He is the co-author of the books: "Enabling
	    Technologies for Petaflops Computing" and "How to Build a Beowulf" and
	    holds six patents.

	    The last year and a half has firmly established cluster systems as the
	    leading approach to scalable high performance computing and PC clusters
	    such as Beowulf-class systems as a major form of clusters. Rapid
	    advances in PC-based SMP nodes, system area networking, and resource
	    management software during this period have transformed a once limited
	    domain of parallel processing into a robust, versatile, and broadly
	    applicable methodology demonstrating unprecedented price-performance
	    advantage with respect to classical vector and MPP type systems. With
	    order of magnitude superiority in cost, Beowulf-class systems and other
	    types of PC clusters have opened up new application domains to low cost
	    parallel computing in science, engineering, industry, commerce,
	    business, and entertainment as well as playing an important role in the
	    explosion of internet and web applications and services. Yet, as
	    important as cost is, so too is the implied convergence to a single
	    general system architecture and programming methodology, supported by
	    many vendors of both hardware and software and towards which education
	    of future programmers can be targeted. The question surrounding

	    general system architecture and programming methodology, supported by
	    many vendors of both hardware and software and towards which education
	    of future programmers can be targeted. The question surrounding
	    Beowulf-class systems is: can they ever approach the capability of the
	    MPP systems they have begun to replace. This talk will examine the gap
	    between emergent Beowulf-class systems and MPPs to provide a realistic
	    measure of the discrepancy of the two systems. Data from both simple
	    test codes and realistic benchmark kernels run on both classes of system
	    will expose the similarities and discrepancies between the two.  It will
	    be shown that there are three general categories of applications: those
	    for which both MPPs and Beowulfs perform as well, those for which MPPs
	    have been shown to be superior in performance, and those for which both
	    classes suffer due to poor memory handling and latency hiding
	    characteristics. Anticipated advances in technology for Beowulfs will be
	    considered in terms of their expected impact in closing the gap of the
	    second category.
