	    <a href="mailto:achien@cs.ucsd.edu">Andrew A. Chien</a>
	    is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of
	    Entropia, Inc. -- an internet computing company which empowers
	    individuals to contribute to "great cause" computations, and delivers
	    large-scale computing resources.  Dr. Chien's research and technology
	    expertise includes networks, communication software, distributed
	    systems, middleware, operating systems, compilers and computer
	    architecture.  Andrew is also the Science Applications International
	    Corporation (SAIC) Chair Professor in the Department of Computer
	    Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego
	    (UCSD).  His previous affiliations include the University of Illinois,
	    the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and the
	    Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  He received his S.B., S.M.,
	    and Sc.D. degrees all from M.I.T.  He has received numerous awards and
	    recognitions for his research.

	    <p>
	    Entropia is building the world's largest general-purpose internet
	    computing system.  These systems will comprise millions (10^6) of
	    processors (megacomputers) and will be the world's first peta-op
	    (10^15 ops/sec) computing systems.  The availability of such
	    megacomputers will enable dramatic advances in science, engineering,
	    and society (e.g. bioinformatics, design, health care, etc.).  Because
	    these platforms will make large-scale computing available to ordinary
	    computer users, they will spark new applications, software, and
	    stimulate radically different algorithms and problem-solving
	    approaches.
	    <p>
	    The design of megacomputer systems is challenging because it requires
	    the synthesis of WWW/internet, high performance computing, and
	    commodity software technologies in a scalable, reliable computing
	    system.  We will discuss the Entropia approach, in particular
	    describing its near term capabilities and applications.  We will also
	    speculate about the future capabilities of megascale systems and their
	    place in large-scale computing.
