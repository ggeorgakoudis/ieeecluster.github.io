	      One day later (the saturday before the first advent, December 2nd) there's a big happening
	      in the city: There's a parade (Bergparade) consisting of around 900 traditionally 
	      dressed miners and musicians coming from the surrounding towns and 
	      villages of Chemnitz.<br>

	      This parade is a tribute to the mining industry 
	      that started in the late Middle Ages and made the region worldwide known 
	      as the "Ore Mountains".<br>

	      The parade is closed by a traditional concert.<p>
	      You are kindly invited to watch this parade to get a small impression
	      about the cultural background of the region.<p>
	      If you are planning to leave Chemnitz on saturday, you should stay
	      at least until around 4 pm to not miss the parade!

	      Besides the parade there is the opportunity to visit 
	      some kind of "active museum" where you can watch the
	      production of several folk-art products that are 
	      manufactured traditionally in the Ore Mountains.

	  On saturday there's also a cultural event in the Town Hall of Chemnitz called
	  "Tage der Ergebirgischen Folklore", or translated 
	  "Days of folklore of the Ore Mountains". This is a traditional
          folk-art program with various artists from the region around 
	  Chemnitz. We also invite all conference attendees to join this 
	  event and we will arrange free admission for everybody.

	      At the Christmas Market itself there are many many cottages (around 170) 
	      offering original folk-art from the Ore Mountains, decoration for the 
              christmas tree, souvenirs, things to eat and drink, and many other things.
