                 <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                 Since systems based on the Alpha processor are popular building blocks for
                 creating the world's most powerful computing clusters, the requirements for
                 these clusters are always important criteria when creating the
                 definition for a new product.<br>
                 When the engineers at Alpha Processor, Inc. (API) were designing the
                 UP2000+, a very important design criterion was to decrease the rack space
                 required while retaining the traditional industry leading performance of
                 previous Alpha designs.  Another important criterion was to maximize the use of
                 commodity components and design features without impacting performance.

                 In this brief talk, we will discuss Intel's activities in cluster
                 computing.  There will be the standard hardware pitch, but on a 
                 more interesting vein, we will discuss Intel's work to help create
                 robust cluster software stacks.  In particular, I will focus on 
                 two cluster recent projects at Intel: (1) a cross industry consortium 
                 to produce open source cluster software stacks and (2) a 
                 collaborative effort with Microsoft to build clusters on top 
                 of Windows 2000.

                 This paper introduces the principles of Agilent's
                 remote system management solutions, which have been
                 designed to maintain and administrate servers and 
                 communication systems. From the standpoint of remote
                 management tasks the required system architecture
                 will be clarified. Different integration strategies
                 for remote system management solutions will be 
                 presented.

                 The Advanced Cluster System (ACS) is one of the first
                 ready to use cluster server on the market. It integrates
                 all basic hard- and software parts into a well tuned system
                 with new dimension of computing power and main memory 
                 available at the desk. The important quality of the ACS is
                 the "single system sight" from the users point of view.
                 Some other qualities are flexibility in terms of hardware
                 equipment, the scalability due to the distributed memory 
                 concept and the well known user interface (LINUX).

                 <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                 Clusters of Computers generally provide a great amount of
                 computing power. However, to utilize these capacities, special parallelized 
                 software is required. This leads to the problem that often either this software is 
                 not available or it is rather complicated to adapt it to the parallel paradigm.
                 The scope of this talk is to show how clusters can be used efficiently 
                 without special parallelization for the user code using the 
                 SynapsPointer<sup>®</sup> framework. The demands for this system, including
                 the introduction of three levels of parallel granularity, are discussed. Two
                 examples demonstrate the application to automated engineering design in
                 combination with optimization algorithms.

                 <b>Abstract:</b><br>
                 WMPI, initially based in MPICH/P4, was the first MPI implementation for 
Windows environments. Seeking for more functionality and usability, WMPI 
was completely re-designed. Its new architecture introduces new concepts 
that allow for dynamic creation and termination of processes as well as the 
usage of multiple devices simultaneously. The new architecture was designed 
to be completely thread-safe and to allow a rapid development of support 
for any communication medium. Due to an effective data flow police 
communication latency was reduced by as much as 50% when compared with 
previous WMPI versions. On top of this new architecture we are developing 
other MPI-2 functionality such as one-sided communications and parallel 
I/O. Prototype implementations of these MPI-2 chapters have been created 
with satisfactory results. New concepts are being introduced in the current 
development of the commercial quality implementations.
