	    SCore Cluster System is an integrated software package for high
	    performace clusters, and is used by worldwide users.
	    SCore and the PM high performance communication library, which supports 
	    various networks available today, was designed simultaneously.
	    As a result, SCore can provide not only high performance
	    cluster computing environment, but also a number of cluster
	    programming facilities in an integrated way. 
	    <p>
	    The unique idea and features implemented in SCore will be addressed,
	    including network trunking, network interleaving, gang-scheduling,
	    checkpoint and restart, real-time monitoring of user programs,
	    deadlock detection, debugging support, etc.
