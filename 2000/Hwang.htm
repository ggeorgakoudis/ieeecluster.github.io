	    In this talk, Dr. Hwang presents on-going research projects on Internet
	    computing and E-commerce at the University of Southern California (USC).
	    In particular, he introduces a scalable security and reliability  (SSR)
	    architecture for use in the next-generation of E-business enterprises.
	    Unique SSR features provide tight security protection, intrusion countermeasures,
	    and automatic recovery from malicious attacks. The research goal is to
	    elevate federated E-business at B2B and B2G levels to a much higher security
	    level, far beyond what can be protected by today's firewall architecture.
	    The work appeals especially to I/O-centric, Internet-based E-commerce and
	    matacomputing grid applications. In particular, Dr. Hwang will describe a
	    distributed RAID-x architecture for distributed database operations in a
	    cluster environment. The RAID-x exploits full I/O bandwidth and protects
	    the cluster platform from all single disk failures. The performance of
	    RAID-x was experimentally proven superior to RAID-1, RAID-5, and NFS in
	    the Trojans Linux cluster built at USC. This architecture greatly enhances
	    the security, reliability, and availability of scalable web server clusters.
