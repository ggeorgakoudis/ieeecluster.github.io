<p>
The importance of large scale data analysis increases year by year in
not only a scientific domain such as high energy physics, astronomy,
biology but also an enterprise domain such as web and mail search
engines.  Moreover, collaborative e-Science activity requires
efficient data sharing and data analysis within a virtual organization
that may consist of several institutes located distantly.
</p>

<p>
The international data analysis challenge --- Finding Supernovae ---
facilitates such a trend and encourages efficient data analysis
efforts in distributed environment.  In this challenge, huge amount of
real scientific data taken by the Subaru telescope for seven years is
used to find new and unknown supernova candidates using several
cluster systems in Japan that consist of thousands of CPU cores, which
includes the InTrigger info-plosion platform and Tokyo Tech TSUBAME.
</p>

<p>
We are inviting research teams or individuals to participate in the
challenge.  Researchers and students working on parallel and
distributed computing and large scale data analysis as well as
astronomical scientists are welcome.  Selected teams will be invited
to present their efforts at the IEEE Cluster/Grid conference.  The
winner will receive a student travel award to help with travel to the
conference.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Subaru Telescope
<p>
Subaru is an 8.2 meter optical-infrared telescope at the summit of
Mauna Kea, Hawaii, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory
of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Science.  For details,
see <a href="http://www.subarutelescope.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.subarutelescope.org/</a> 
</p>

</li>
<li> InTrigger info-plosion platform
<p>
InTrigger is a distributed computing platform spread around Japan.  As
of the competition, it consists of about 850 CPU cores across eleven
clusters.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<b>* <u>Challenge Criteria</u></b>

<p>
Real scientific data taken by the Subaru telescope is dispersed across
several clusters in the Challenge platform.  The challengers find all
supernova candidates using the Challenge platform.  To find all
supernova candidates, it is necessary to compare every two shots taken
at an interval of one month.  The data analysis program is given,
while it is allowed to optimize it as long as the result is not
changed.  There are two challenge categories BS and FT.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>** Category BS: basic category
  </dt>
<dd>
<p>
The challengers compete in the total time to find all supernova
candidates.  There is no restriction on programming language and
distributed computing middleware.  Any failure during the execution is
not assumed in this category.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>** Category FT: fault tolerant category
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
The challengers compete in the total time to find all supernova
candidates under a scenario of artificial node failure.  Some
processes will be killed according to the failure scenario.  Although
a trial scenario is prepared, a scenario for the challenge is not
provided until the final measurement.  There is no restriction on
programming language and distributed computing middleware as the
Category BS.
