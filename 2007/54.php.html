One of the most useful features provided by virtualmachine
(VM) technologies is the ability to migrate running
OS instances across distinct physical nodes. As a basis
for many administration tools in modern clusters and
data-centers, VM migration is desired to be extremely efficient
to reduce both migration time and performance
impact on hosted applications.
<p>Currently, most VM environments use the Socket interface
and the TCP/IP protocol to transfer VM migration
traffic. In this paper, we propose a high performance
VM migration design by using RDMA (Remote Direct
Memory Access). RDMA is a feature provided by many
modern high speed interconnects that are currently being
widely deployed in data-centers and clusters. By taking
advantage of the low software overhead and the onesided
nature of RDMA, our design significantly improves
the efficiency of VM migration. We also contribute a set
of micro-benchmarks and application-level benchmark
evaluations aimed at evaluating important metrics of VM
migration. The evaluations using our prototype implementation
over Xen and InfiniBand show that RDMA can
drastically reduce the migration overhead: up to 80% on
total migration time and up to 77% on application observed
downtime.</i>
