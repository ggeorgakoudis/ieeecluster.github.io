Achieving high performance for out-of-core
applications typically involves explicit management of the
movement of data between the disk and the physical
memory. We are developing a programming environment
in which the different levels of the memory hierarchy are
handled efficiently in a unified transparent framework. In
this paper, we present our experiences with implementing
efficient non-collective I/O (GPC-IO) as part of this
framework. As a generalization of the Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) that was used as a foundation for the Sun
NFS system, we developed a global procedure call (GPC)
to invoke procedures on a remote node to handle noncollective
I/O. We consider alternative approaches that can
be employed in implementing this functionality. The approaches
are evaluated using a representative computation
from quantum chemistry. The results demonstrate that
GPC-IO achieves better absolute execution times, strongscaling,
and weak-scaling than the alternatives considered.</i>
