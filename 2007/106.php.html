Clusters of Computers have become a costeffective
alternative for parallel and distributed computing
systems processing computationally intensive tasks. Normally,
clusters are composed of high performance computational nodes
linked together by low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnection
networks. With the advent of modern optical networking
technologies, latency in long-distance links is close to that of
local-area links. By using Service Address Routed (SAR) optical
networks, NEOS-based clusters can be used transparently as
single, tightly-coupled clusters of computers, regardless of the
distance between their components while keeping a simple
service-oriented interface. A performance-wise analysis of such
clusters is presented in this work.<i>
