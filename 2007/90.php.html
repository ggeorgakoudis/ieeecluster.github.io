Understanding the behavior and impact of various
sources of Operating System Jitter (OS Jitter) is important
not only for tuning a system for HPC applications, but
also for the ongoing efforts to create light-weight versions
of commercial operating systems such as Linux, that can
be used on compute nodes of large scale HPC systems.
In this paper, we present a tool that helps in identifying
sources of OS Jitter in a commodity operating system such
as Linux and measures the impact of OS Jitter through
ne grained kernel instrumentation. Our methodology
comprises of running a user-level micro-benchmark and
measuring the latencies experienced by the benchmark. We
then associate each latency to operating system daemons
and interrupts using data obtained from kernel instrumentation.
We present experimental results that help identify
the biggest contributors to the total OS Jitter perceived by
an application on a commodity operating system such as
Linux. Our results revealed that while 63% of the total
jitter comes from timer interrupts, the rest comes from
various system daemons and interrupts, most of which can
be easily eliminated. The tool presented in this paper can
also be used to tune .out of the box. commodity operating
systems as well as to detect new sources of operating
system jitter that get introduced as software get installed
and upgraded on a tuned system.</i>
