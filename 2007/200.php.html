<i><p>
This is the sixth edition of the International Workshop
on Algorithms, Models and Tools for Parallel Computing on
Heterogeneous Networks (HeteroPar 2007). The response to
the call for papers was very good: we received 17 strong
submissions from 9 countries including Austria, China, France,
Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Spain and Tunisia.
<p>All submitted papers were distributed to four members
of the Program Committee for evaluation. The PC members
either reviewed the papers themselves, or solicited external
reviewers. The reviewing process went quite smoothly, and
each paper received at least 3 reviews. The final decisions on
acceptance/rejection were based upon the reviews resulting in
selection of 9 papers.
<p>We congratulate the authors of accepted papers, and we
regret that some potentially interesting papers could not be
accepted, mainly due to unsatisfactory quality of presentation
of the research results. The presentation of the accepted papers
is organized in 3 sessions:<br>
<br> o Scheduling on Heterogeneous Platforms;
<br> o Applications;
<br> o New Trends in Heterogeneous Computing.
<p>Altogether, the papers cover a broad spectrum of topics presenting
new ideas, dedicated algorithms, and tools for efficient
use of heterogeneous networks of computers.
<p>We would like to thank all the authors submitted their work
to HeteroPar 2007. We are very grateful to all the PC members
for their efforts in promoting the workshop and reviewing the
manuscripts. HeteroPar 2007 is held in association with the
IEEE Cluster 2007. We really appreciate the cooperation and
assistance we have received from the Cluster 2007 organizers
and we particularly express our gratitude to Dan Katz and
Kent Milfeld.</i>
