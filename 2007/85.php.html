The service-oriented architecture has come a long
way in solving the problem of reusability of existing software
resources. Grid applications today are composed of a large
number of loosely coupled services. While this has opened up
new avenues for building large, complex applications, it has
made the management of the application components a nontrivial
task. Use of services existing on different platforms,
implemented in different languages and presence of variety
of network constraints further complicates management.
<p>This paper investigates problems that emerge when
there is a need to uniformly manage a set of distributed
services. We present a scalable, fault-tolerant management
framework. Our empirical evaluation shows that the
architecture adds an acceptable number of additional
resources for providing scalable, fault-tolerant management
framework.
