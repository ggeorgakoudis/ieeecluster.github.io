In large-scale distributed execution environments
such as multicluster systems and grids, resource availability
may vary due to resource failures and because resources may
be added to or withdrawn from such environments at any
time. In addition, single sites in such systems may have to
deal with workloads originating from both local users and from
many other sources. As a result, application malleability, that
is, the property of applications to deal with a varying amount
of resources during their execution, may be very beneficial
for performance. In this paper we present the design of the
support of and scheduling policies for malleability in our KOALA
multicluster scheduler with the help of our DYNACO framework
for application malleability. In addition, we show the results of
experiments with scheduling malleable workloads with KOALA
in our DAS multicluster testbed.</i>
