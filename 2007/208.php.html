A schedule is said robust if it is able to
absorb some degree of uncertainty in tasks duration while
maintaining a stable solution. This intuitive notion of
robustness has led to a lot of different interpretations and
metrics. However, no comparison of these different metrics
have ever been preformed. In this paper, we perform an
experimental study of these different metrics and show
how they are correlated to each other in the case of task
scheduling, with dependencies between tasks.</i>
