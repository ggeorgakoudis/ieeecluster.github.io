Energy conservation is a dynamic topic of research
in High Performance Computing and Cluster Computing. Poweraware
computing for heterogeneous world-wide Grid is a new
track of research. In this work, we study and evaluate the impact
of the heterogeneity of the nodes of a computing platform on
the energy consumption. We propose to take advantage of this
heterogeneity in order to save energy with no significant loss
of performance by using Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) in a
distributed eigensolver. We show that using DVS only during
the slack-time does not penalize the performances but it does
not provide significant energy savings. If DVS is applied to all
the execution, we get important global and local energy savings
(respectively up to 9% and 20%) without a significant rise of the
wall-clock times.</i>
