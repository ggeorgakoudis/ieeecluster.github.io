In this article we tackle the problem of scheduling a
dynamically generated DAG of multi-processor tasks (M-tasks).
At first, we outline the need of such a scheduling approach in
the context of TGrid. TGrid is an M-task runtime system for
heterogeneous clusters. Then, we propose a dynamic scheduling
algorithm called Reuse Processors Algorithm (RePA). The main
objective of RePA is to reduce the communication and redistribution
costs by trying to map child tasks to processors which
are assigned to parent tasks (reuse processors). The algorithm
is implemented using the SimGrid toolkit and is evaluated by
comparing the makespan of the schedules produced by RePA
and M-HEFT.</i>
