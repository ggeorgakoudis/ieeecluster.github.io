Memory copies are widely regarded as detrimental to the
overall performance of applications. High-performance systems
make every effort to reduce the number of memory
copies, especially the copies incurred during message passing.
State of the art implementations of message-passing
libraries, such as MPI, utilize user-level networking protocols
to reduce or eliminate memory copies. InfiniBand is
an emerging user-level networking technology that is gaining
rapid acceptance in several domains, including HPC.
In order to eliminate message copies while transferring
large messages, MPI libraries over InfiniBand employ zerocopy
protocols which use Remote Direct Memory Access
(RDMA). RDMA is available only in the connection-oriented
transports of InfiniBand, such as Reliable Connection (RC).
However, the Unreliable Datagram (UD) transport of Infini-
Band has been shown to scale much better than the RC transport
in regard to memory usage. In an optimal design, it
should be possible to perform zero-copy message transfers
over scalable transports (such as UD).
In this paper, we present our design of a novel zero-copy
protocol which is directly based over the scalable UD transport.
Thus, our protocol achieves the twin objectives of scalability
and good performance. Our analysis shows that unidirectional
messaging bandwidth can be within 9% of what
is achievable over RC for messages of 64KB and above. Application
benchmark evaluation shows that our design delivers
a 21% speedup for the in.rhodo dataset for LAMMPS
over a copy-based approach, giving performance within 1%
of RC.</i>
