Large-scale parallel applications often produce immense
quantities of data that need to be analyzed. To avoid
performing repeated, costly disk accesses, analysis of large
data sets generally requires a commensurately large amount of
memory. While some data-analysis tools can easily be parallelized
to distribute memory across a cluster, other tools are either
difficult to parallelize or, in the case of simple data-analysis
scripts with short lifespans, not worth the effort to parallelize.
In this work, we present and analyze the performance of
JumboMem, a simple, entirely user-level parallel program that
enables unmodified sequential applications to access all of the
memory in a cluster. Although there are many implementations
of memory servers, all require either administrative privileges or
program modifications. More importantly, no existing memory
server has been evaluated on modern workstation clusters with
high-speed networks, many nodes, and significant quantities of
memory. This paper represents the first study of memory-server
performance at supercomputing scales.</i>
