The thermal environment of data centers plays a
significant role in affecting the energy efficiency and the reliability
of data center operation. A dominant problem associated with
cooling data centers is the recirculation of hot air from the
equipment outlets to their inlets, causing the appearance of
hot spots and an uneven inlet temperature distribution. Heat is
generated due to the execution of tasks, and it varies according
to the power profile of a task. We are looking into the prospect
of assigning the incoming tasks around the data center in such a
way so as to make the inlet temperatures as even as possible; this
will allow for considerable cooling power savings. Based on our
previous research work on characterizing the heat recirculation
in terms of cross-interference coefficients, we propose a task
scheduling algorithm for homogeneous data centers, called XInt,
that minimizes the inlet temperatures, and leads to minimal heat
recirculation and minimal cooling energy cost for data center
operation. We verify, through both theoretical formalization and
simulation, that minimizing heat recirculation will result in the
best cooling energy efficiency. XInt leads to an inlet temperature
distribution that is 2C to 5C lower than other approaches,
and achieves about 20%-30% energy savings at moderate data
center utilization rates. XInt also consistently achieves the best
energy efficiency compared to another recirculation minimized
algorithm, MinHR.</i>
