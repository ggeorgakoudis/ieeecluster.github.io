Mapping applications onto parallel platforms is a
challenging problem, even for simple application patterns such
as pipeline or fork graphs. Several antagonist criteria should
be optimized for workflow applications, such as throughput and
latency (or a combination). In this paper, we consider a simplified
model with no communication cost, and we provide an exhaustive
list of complexity results for different problem instances. Some
instances are shown to be NP-hard, thereby exposing the inherent
complexity of the mapping problem. We provide polynomial
algorithms for other problem instances. Altogether, we provide
solid theoretical foundations for the study of mono-criterion or
bi-criteria mapping optimization problems.</i>
