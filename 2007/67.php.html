Multiple clusters co-existing in a single research
campus has become commonplace at many university and
government labs, but effectively leveraging those resources is
difficult. Intelligently forwarding and spanning jobs across clusters
can increase throughput, decrease turnaround time, and
improve overall utilization. Dynamic Virtual Clustering (DVC)
is a system of virtual machines, deployed in a single or multicluster
environment, to increase cluster utilization by enabling
job forwarding and spanning, flexibly allow software environment
changes, and effectively sandbox users and processes from each
other and the system. This paper presents both the initial
implementation of DVC and performance results from synthetic
workloads executed under DVC.</i>
