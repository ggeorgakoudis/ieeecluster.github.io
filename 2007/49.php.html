Improving the performance of TCP communication
is the key to the successful deployment of MPI programs in a Grid
environment in which multiple clusters are connected through
high performance dedicated networks. To efficiently utilize the
inter-cluster bandwidth, a traffic control mechanism is required
so as not to allow the aggregate transmission bandwidth to exceed
the inter-cluster bandwidth when multiple nodes communicate at
one time. In this paper, we propose a traffic control method for
MPI programs, in which an application or the MPI runtime controls
the transmission rate based on the communication pattern
by using certain MPI attributes. Packet pacing is used at each
node preventing microscopic burst transmission to thus avoid
congestion. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method
by experiments using a 10 Gbps emulated WAN environment.
We show most of the NAS Parallel benchmarks improve the
performance, since the proposed method reduces packet losses
due to traffic congestion on the inter-cluster network. The results
have indicated that it is feasible to connect multiple clusters
and run large-scale scientific applications over distances up to
1000 kilometers, if an appropriate network is available.</i>
