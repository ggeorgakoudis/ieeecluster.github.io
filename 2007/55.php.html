JaSkel is a skeleton-based framework to develop
efficient concurrent, parallel and Grid applications. It provides a
set of Java abstract classes that implement recurring parallel
interaction paradigms. The key feature of JaSkel is to use
aspect-oriented external tools to address distributed execution,
by injecting code to support communication middleware into
JaSkel built-in skeleton implementations. This feature, when
combined with the ability to develop nested skeletons, can help to
tailor JaSkel applications to efficiently run on a Grid of clusters
systems, by taking advantage of inter/intra-cluster and/or
intra-node communications. This paper describes the JaSkel
distributed execution tools and how they interplay with the
JaSkel framework to transparently run applications on a wide
range of computing platforms, from multi-core to computational
Grids. Results are presented to show the feasibility and
scalability of this approach.</i>
