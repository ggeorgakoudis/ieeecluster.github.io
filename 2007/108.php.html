High-performance computing (HPC) systems
consume a significant amount of power, resulting in high
operational costs, reduced reliability, and wasting of natural
resources. Therefore, power consumption has become an
increasingly important design constraint in high-performance
clusters. In this regard, research on power-aware HPC has
emerged. While most research has focused at understanding and
utilizing applicationsÂ’ behavior to scale down the CPU for energy
savings, this paper demonstrates the positive impact of modern
interconnects in delivering energy-efficiency in highperformance
clusters. In this work, we first present the powerperformance
profiles of the Myrinet-2000 and Quadrics QsNetII
at the user-level and MPI-level in comparison to a traditional,
non-offloaded Gigabit Ethernet. Such information enables us to
devise a power-aware MPI runtime library that automatically
and transparently performs message segmentation and reassembly
in order to increase energy savings. Secondly, by
designing and evaluating a number of all-gather collectives, we
argue that it is possible to increase the energy-efficiency of a
cluster by optimizing its messaging layers.</i>
