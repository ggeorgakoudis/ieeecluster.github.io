Disk subsystem is known to be a major contributor
to the overall power budget of large-scale parallel systems. Most
scientific applications today rely heavily on disk I/O for outof-
core computations, checkpointing, and visualization of data.
To reduce excess energy consumption on disk system, prior
studies proposed several hardware or OS-based disk power
management schemes. While such schemes have been known
to be effective in certain cases, they might miss opportunities
for better energy savings due to their reactive nature. While
compiler based schemes can make more accurate decisions on
a given application by extracting disk access patterns statically,
the lack of runtime information on the status of shared disks
may lead to wrong decisions when multiple applications exercise
the same set of disks concurrently. In this paper, we propose a
runtime system based approach that provides more effective disk
power management. In our scheme, the compiler provides crucial
information on the future disk access patterns and preferred
disk speeds from the perspective of individual applications, and
a runtime system uses this information along with current state
of the shared disks to make decisions that are agreeable to all
applications.We implemented our runtime system support within
PVFS2, a parallel file system. Our experimental results with
four I/O-intensive scientific applications indicate large energy
savings: 19.4% and 39.9% over the previously-proposed pure
software and pure hardware based schemes, respectively. We
further show in this paper that our scheme can achieve consistent
energy savings with a varying number and mix of applications
and different disk layouts of data.</i>
