Various mechanisms for fault-tolerance (FT) are
used today in order to reduce the impact of failures on application
execution. In the case of system failure, standard FT mechanisms
are checkpoint/restart (for reactive FT) and migration (for
pro-active FT). However, each of these mechanisms create an
overhead on application execution, overhead that for instance
becomes critical on large-scale systems where previous studies
have shown that applications may spend more time checkpointing
state than performing useful work.
<p>In order to decrease this overhead, researchers try to both
optimize existing FT mechanisms and implement new FT policies.
For instance, combining reactive and pro-active approaches in
order to decrease the number of checkpoints that must be
performed during the applicationÂ’s execution. However, currently
no solutions exist which enable the evaluation of these FT
approaches through simulation, instead experimentations must
be done using real platforms. This increases complexity and limits
experimentation into alternate solutions.
<p>This paper presents a simulation framework that evaluates
different FT mechanisms and policies. The framework uses
system failure logs for the simulation with a default behavior
based on logs taken from the ASCI White at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. We evaluate the accuracy of our simulator
comparing simulated results with those taken from experiments
done on a 32-node compute cluster. Therefore such a simulator
can be used to develop new FT policies and/or to tune existing
policies.</i>
