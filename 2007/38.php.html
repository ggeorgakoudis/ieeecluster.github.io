The problem of scheduling multiple divisible and indivisible
tasks on a distributed bus network with start-up costs is
considered. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to
schedule both divisible and indivisible tasks. We utilize oneround
installment load distribution strategy for scheduling
divisible tasks. We analyze the properties of our proposed
algorithm. We demonstrate how our proposed algorithm
works by means of multiple illustrative examples. We measure
the performance of our proposed algorithm. We conclude
our proposed algorithm is more feasible than others.
The analysis provides deeper understanding of scheduling
multiple divisible and indivisible tasks in the more realistic
model, which will allow us to design more efficient algorithms.</i>
