Modern supercomputers aggregate thousands of microprocessors
through a high performance network. Many of
these systems place a processor on the network interface
controller (NIC) to handle some portion of the MPI processing.
This processing involves traversing a linked list
and invoking a matching function for each item. Although
this task is critical to the performance of the system,
microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore,
the traditional network processor approaches of multicore
and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the
list is a shared data structure. While match processing can
be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations
can be extremely in_exible and lead to extremely
high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable
architecture for a processor to handle the matching function.
The matching engine approaches the performance
of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining
a high degree of _exibility and programmability. More
importantly, it requires a dramatically smaller area than
a conventional processor.
