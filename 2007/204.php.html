In this paper an analytical comparison of the
performance behavior of parallel flavors of the well-known
Binary Merge Sort and Bitonic Sort algorithm in a Grid
environment is presented.
<p>To keep the analysis clear and focused we concentrate on a
limited number of characteristic parameters and develop a concise
but comprehensive analytical model both for a generalized
multiprocessor framework and a simplified heterogenous Grid
Environment.
<p>We justify that a meaningful model can be built upon only
three characteristic parameter sets, describing node processing
performance, the I/O and the disk bandwidth, which are the
parameters for the optimization the Grid workflow by a smart
brokerage mechanism. Based on these results the paper proves
that by a smart enhancement of the algorithms exploiting the
specifics of the Grid the well-known results of Bitton et al. for
a homogenous multi-processor architecture are invalidated and
reversed for a heterogenous Grid environment.</i>
