In many data analysis applications, application-level
parameters influence the execution time of the data analysis
method or program. Some of these parameters also affect the
accuracy of output of the analysis. In this work, we investigate
execution strategies for adaptive data analysis applications where
the user is willing to trade-off accuracy of output for performance
gain and vice-versa. In order to meet the user defined quality of
service requirements, the system must dynamically select values
for the parameters during execution. We propose algorithms for
adaptive processing of image tiles at different resolutions so that
user defined requirements in terms of accuracy of the result and
execution time constraints can be satisfied. We develop heuristics
for estimation of accuracy vs performance characteristics of
image tiles and for scheduling of the tiles for processing. We
implement a demand-driven strategy for parallel execution of
these heuristics on a parallel machine. We evaluate our approach
for analysis of large images from digitized microscopy scanners.</i>
