Distributed Computing Systems are a viable and
less expensive alternative to parallel computers. However, a
serious difficulty in concurrent programming of a distributed
system is how to deal with scheduling and load balancing of
such a system which may consist of heterogeneous computers.
Loop scheduling schemes for parallel computers and computer
clusters have been proposed in the past. All these schemes
are one-dimensional because they partition only the outermost
loop of a nested loop construct. In this work, we consider
scheduling nested loops with many dimensions. We propose a
new methodology which partitions many levels (or dimensions)
of nested loops. These new schemes show superior performance
over the existing schemes. We implement our new schemes on
a network of computers and make performance comparisons
with other existing schemes. We expect the new schemes to be
particularly useful for multi-core systems because of the fine
granularity of the generated tasks.</i>
