<i>Economy-based admission control of jobs in a grid,
or migration of guest jobs from a disconnecting cluster in a grid, as
well as checkpointing parallel jobs in a cluster to a central repository
are demanding tasks that can exhaust essential resources such as
the communication networks, due to the requirement to quickly move
large amounts of data from many nodes. Compressing memory images
might make these operations more efficient provided that the overall
throughput is increased. Existing serial compression algorithms are
not suitable for such purposes because they do not exploit interfile
redundancy. This paper presents decentralized algorithms for
parallel compression of correlated memory images of a job in a
cluster or in a grid. The algorithms use block suppression to eliminate
inter-file redundancy. They take advantage of the multiple processor
environment to simultaneously map memory blocks to hash values
in order to detect redundancies. It is shown that exploiting interfile
redundancy of correlated files can increase the overall transfer
throughput of parallel jobs. It is also shown that combining serial
compression with our algorithms further increases this throughput.
The paper presents the algorithms and their performance.</i>
