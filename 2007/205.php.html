This paper introduces a parallel algorithm to solve
large stiff ODE systems in a geographically distant cluster
environment. This algorithm is based on the coupling of the
Waveform Relaxation concept and the CVODE algorithm. With
respect to the standard PVODE algorithm, it allows to drastically
reduce the number of messages exchanged between nodes. It
is a coarse grained algorithm well suited for distant grid
environments connected via high latency networks. In this paper
our work consists in analyzing the execution times taken by the
PVODE solver and our algorithm and in explaining the benefits
brought by this work.</i>
