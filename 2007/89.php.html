<i>
The Kautz digraph [1,2] has been described as the ideal
communication network for parallel computers, but it is
generally unknown in the engineering community, and has never
previously been used in a commercial product. We will define
and characterize it in relation to HPC clusters, then discuss some
of the implementation issues encountered in developing it as a
large-scale cluster interconnect. The software interface to this
interconnect is explained with some initial experiences with
performance benchmarks.</i>
