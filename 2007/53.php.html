There exist several scheduling schemes for
parallelizing loops without dependences for shared and
distributed memory systems. However, efficiently parallelizing
loops with dependences is a more complicated task. This becomes
even more difficult when the loops are executed on a distributed
memory cluster where communication and synchronization can
be a bottleneck. The problem lies in the processor idle time which
occurs during the beginning and final stages of the execution. In
this paper we propose a new scheduling scheme that minimizes
the processor idle time and thus it enhances load balancing and
performance. The new scheme is applied to two-dimensional
iteration spaces with dependences. The proposed scheduling
scheme follows a tiled wavefront pattern in which the tile size
gradually decreases in all dimensions. We have tested the
proposed scheme on a dedicated and homogeneous cluster of
workstations and we verified that it significantly improves
execution times over scheduling using traditional tiling.</i>
