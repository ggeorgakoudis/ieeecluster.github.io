The complexity of todayÂ’s computer systems poses
a challenge to system administrators. Current systems comprise
a multitude of inter-related software components running on
different servers. In this paper, we propose the use of the
stackable storage mechanism as the foundation of centralized
systems management. At the management level, we show how
this mechanism can be used to implement an infrastructure
that allows administrators to perform typical tasks fast and
effortlessly. In particular, we find that our prototype could have
avoided 40% of the human mistakes observed experimentally
by previous research. At the storage level, we identify three
key characteristics of stackable storage that allow the definition
of different policies with distinct performance and scalability
behaviors. We quantitatively compare five storage policies under
different workloads and conclude that stackable storage is a
viable approach.</i>
