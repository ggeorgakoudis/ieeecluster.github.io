In parallel applications communication overheads
generally increase as the processor count increases
and in particular, collective communication operations can
become a critical limiting factor in achieving high performance.
In this paper we explore a novel technique to boost
application performance by dedicating some processors in the
system to collective operations. We demonstrate the viability
and efficiency of this approach for the Allreduce collective
operation on a state-of-the-art cluster. Experimental results
show that the collective latency can be reduced by 30%
and that the communication overhead per processor is also
very low, at 1.6 us which represents one order of magnitude
higher performance than with conventional implementations.
Moreover, results on a large-scale scientific application (POP)
show that this approach achieves 15% higher performance
on 640 processors than when using the default collective
implementation.</i>
