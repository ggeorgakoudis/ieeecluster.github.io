<i><p>
PCI Express (PCIe), the I/O interconnect of choice in
today's single host computing platform, is being
enhanced to support features that include I/O
virtualization and processor-coprocessor
interconnect. Host-to-host communication, however,
is regarded as beyond the scope of PCIe. As such, the
model in today's multi-compute platforms is to utilize
PCIe for communication between the host(s) and the
I/O subsystem while a dedicated clustering
interconnect such as Infiniband or Ethernet is used
for host-to-host communication.
<p>The Dolphin Express solution (i.e. Dolphin's
enhanced PCIe hardware and accompanying
software) addresses the shortcoming of host-to-host
communication in PCIe in a cost-effective manner.
To the best of our knowledge, these products provide
an industry first solution of using a PCIe-based
switch fabric to seamlessly integrate both IO and
clustering capabilities-- thereby obviating the need
for an additional clustering interconnect.
<p>As a first step towards providing a full-fledged
clustering solution, we have provided support for
TCP/IP protocol over PCIe (IPoPCIe). Based on
benchmarking results, IPoPCIe was able to achieve
performance that was on par or better than that of a
10GigE NIC¬Åfs. On a 2-node system connected using
a switch, IPoPCIe shows an end-to-end application
latency of ~14us and bandwidth of up to 1270MB/s.
<p>Though the results are promising, the performance of
IPoPCIe is greatly influenced by overheads
associated with TCP/IP stack processing. Hence,
work is ongoing on supporting the TCP/IP sockets
interface but without incurring the traditional
TCP/IP stack overheads. This would utilize the full
potential of the underlying Dolphin Express
hardware and lead to further reduction in latency,
lower CPU utilization and increased bandwidth.
