The data needs of current and future PetaScale
applications have increased over the last half decade to the
extent that appropriate data management has become a crucial
requirement. This concerns not only the storage of data produced
by the new class of PetaScale applications, but also the data
exchanges needed for coupling applications with concurrent
analysis, online data visualization for validation, and others.
To address such dynamic code coupling, we introduce the
concept of an extensible, dynamic, and flexible data workspace,
termed LIVE. In contrast to the data exchanges programmed
with MPI, MPI-IO, or grid software, LIVE focuses on data
exchanges carried out without a priori knowledge of potential
data requirements. Examples include exchanges required by adhoc
or dynamically determined methods for data validation,
for general data analysis tasks, or for data visualization. Run
on an execution environment comprised of integrated dynamic
discovery and on-line management services, LIVE is used to
create a 'data workspace' for a working molecular dynamics code
base utilized by mechanical and materials engineers at Georgia
Tech, for multi-scale materials modeling. Measurements of both
this application's data workspace and of the basic primitives
in the LIVE framework demonstrate that the environment's
substantial flexibility has minimal impact on overall performance,
and in fact, that it improves performance in a number of usage
scenarios. In particular, for a visualization pipeline example
derived from our collaborators, we see a slight improvement
over a solution based on MPI-IO, and a further improvement of
up to 5% by utilizing LIVE's ability to overlap communication
with user-specified computation.</i>
