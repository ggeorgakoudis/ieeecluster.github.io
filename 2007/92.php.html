A critical problem facing by managing large-scale
clusters is to identify the location of problems in a system
in case of unusual events. As the scale of high performance
computing (HPC) grows, systems are getting bigger. When a
system fails to function properly, health-related data are collected
for troubleshooting. However, due to the massive quantities of
information obtained from a large number of components, the
root causes of anomalies are often buried like needles in a
haystack. In this paper, we present a localization method to
automatically find out the potential root causes (i.e. a subset
of nodes) of the problem from the overwhelming amount of data
collected system-wide. System managers can focus on examining
these potential locations, thereby significantly reducing human
efforts required for anomaly localization. Our method consists
of three interrelated steps: (1) feature collection to assemble a
feature space for the system; (2) feature extraction to obtain the
most significant features for efficient data analysis by applying
the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm; and (3) outlier
detection to quickly identify the nodes that are far away
from the majority by using the cell-based detection algorithm.
Preliminary studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of
our method for localizing anomalies in a computing environment
where the nodes perform comparable tasks.</i>
