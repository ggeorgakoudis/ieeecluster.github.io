Checkpoint-restart is considered one of the most
natural approaches to achieving fault-tolerance in a highperformance
cluster. While experiences has focused attention on
user-level solutions, the advent of efficient system-level virtualization
software, such as Xen and VMWare, has opened the door to
the possibility of efficient and scalable cluster-level virtualization.
<p>In this paper we present an innovative approach to cluster fault
tolerance by integrating the Xen virtualization with the latest generation
of the InfiniBand network. A major contribution of this
approach is the automatic identification of global recovery lines
to freeze the status of the machine. Our focus is on the partitioned
global address space (PGAS) programming models. PGAS models
has been receiving an increasing amount of attention in the recent
years. We have developed a global coordination mechanism and
deployed it in the Aggregate Remote Memory Copy Interface
(ARMCI) one-sided communication library that has been used
as a run-time system for several PGAS languages and libraries.
The experimental results show that it is possible to virtualize
communication and computation with minimal overhead and to
provide seamless migration capabilities.</i>
