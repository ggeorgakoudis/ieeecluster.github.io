<i>
Pioneering work on Aspect Oriented Programming
(AOP) has not flourished enough to enrich the design
of distributed systems with the refined AOP paradigm.
The more generous perspective today is that a decade
of growing research on AOP has brought the paradigm
into many exciting areas. We, therefore, investigate
two case studies that cover time-honored issues, fault
tolerant computing and parallel computing, in the cluster
computing world using the AOP paradigm. Aspects
that we define here are simple, intuitive and reusable.
We believe that our implementation is very useful in
developing other cluster computing software programs,
and AOP can be a powerful method in modularizing
source codes.</i>
