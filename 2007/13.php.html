This paper will summarize an IO1 performance
analysis effort performed on Sandia National Laboratories Red
Storm platform. Our goal was to examine the IO system
performance and identify problems or bottle-necks in any aspect
of the IO sub-system. Our process examined the entire IO path
from application to disk both in segments and as a whole. Our
final analysis was performed at scale employing parallel IO
access methods typically used in High Performance Computing
applications.</i>
