<i>
A new communication model, called the PlogPT
model, is proposed to predict communication performance in
a commodity cluster where computing nodes communicate using
TCP/IP. This model extends the PlogP model in order to consider
the variation of bandwidth brought about by bottleneck links
in network switches and the delay of packet retransmission
by TCP/IP handling. Network switches are modeled as binary
tree connections. To demonstrate the PlogPT modelÂ’s modeling
capability, the execution time of two all-to-all communication
algorithms are estimated and compared with the actual execution
time and that of the PlogP model. The PlogPT model predicts
the execution time of those two algorithms more precisely than
the existing model.</i>
