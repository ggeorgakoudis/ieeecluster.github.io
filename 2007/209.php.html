Analytical communication performance models play
an important role in prediction of the execution time of parallel
applications on multiprocessors. Apart from designing such a
model, accurate estimation of the values of its parameters is one
of the main issues. This paper deals with a heterogeneous
analytical communication model designed for prediction of MPI
communications on heterogeneous clusters based on a switched
network. Accurate estimation of the parameters of this model is a
particularly challenging task due to a large number of the
parameters. In this paper, we present a solution of the task based
on a carefully designed set of communication experiments, which
not only allows us to obtain the accurate estimation of the
parameters but also tries to minimise the total execution time of
the experiments. Experiments demonstrating the accuracy and
efficiency of the proposed solution are also presented.</i>
