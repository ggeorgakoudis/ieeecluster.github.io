Quantum computing has the potential to
revolutionize the field of computing, but with hardware
and algorithms unlike any in use today. Due to the
primitive state of existing quantum hardware,
simulation is one of the most effective methods for
studying quantum computing issues. Our team
previously developed a general-purpose simulator
capable of modeling arbitrary quantum algorithms
executing on any hardware device. The simulator
performs over a thousand matrix multiplications per
step as part of its operations. To improve the simulator
performance, optimizations were designed to
dynamically restructure the problem. The resulting
calculations were then distributed across a cluster.
These enhancements reduced both the order of the
simulator operations and the memory overhead,
achieving an overall performance improvement of
99.94% from the initial implementation of a key
quantum algorithm, reducing the simulator run time
for this algorithm from two days on a single processor
to under two minutes on a cluster.</i>
