This paper describes a pipelined parallel algorithm
for the Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (OSIC) decoding
procedure proposed in V-BLAST wireless MIMO systems.
It is based on an algorithm that solves the Recursive Least
Squares (RLS) problem, and is derived from a block version
of the square root version of the Kalman Filter. It has been
parallelized in a pipelined way getting a good efficiency and
scalability in a heterogeneous network of computers. Although
the optimum load balancing for this algorithm is dynamic, we
derive a static load balancing scheme with good results.</i>
