## Conference Venue
**Assembly Buildings Conference Centre Fisherwick Place, Belfast BT1 6DW** 

The conference venue is the [Assembly Buildings Conference
Centre](http://www.assemblybuildings.co.uk/), located in the heart of Belfast
city centre.  It is a state-of-the-art facility in one of the city’s most
historic buildings.  Built in 1905, the Assembly Buildings is one of the most
impressive buildings in Belfast’s city centre.  Designed in the architectural
style of a Scottish baronial castle, the gothic structure boasts a 40m high
clock tower, a bell tower housing Belfast’s only operational peal of 12 bells,
and several exquisite stain glass windows.  Following an £8million
refurbishment in 2010, the facility offers state-of-the-art technology in a
historically rich environment.
