The Mentoring Program at IEEE Cluster 2018 is a program for PhD, Master, and
Undergraduate students that wants to help students building their scientific
career as efficiently as possible. The scientific presentations and
interactions with conference attendees help them develop their technical
skills. The Student Mentoring Program complements and extends this development
by fostering the integration of the students into the Cluster scientific
community, advising them to plan their professional career in academia or
industry, improving their scientific communication skills, and providing them
with the right entry points for efficient professional networking.

## Applying to the Mentoring Program
The Student Mentoring Program is
not just another publication venue. All interested students can apply through a
simple, non-competitive process, by providing a short description of why they
want to participate in the conference, the id(s) of any works submitted to the
conference or associated workshops, the name of their advisor, and their CV.
The student’s adviser should endorse the student’s application and will be
contacted once the application is submitted.

## Student travel awards - for students at U.S. institutions
Thanks to the National Science Foundation, several travel awards will be
available for students enrolled in US institutions and participating in the
Student Mentoring Program at the IEEE Cluster 2018 conference. Students with
accepted papers in the main conference track or in workshops, or students with
posters must apply to and participate in the Student Mentoring Program to be
eligible for the travel award. Notice of travel awards will be made prior to
the conference. The travel awards will be distributed post-conference in the
form of reimbursements against actual travel, registration, and accommodation
expenses submitted by the student. Both graduate and undergraduate students can
apply.

## Submission Guidelines
Please submit your application via the [submission system.](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ieeecluster/?page=Submit&id=StudentApplication&site=ieeecluster2018)

## Important Dates 
Applications will be reviewed starting July 23, 2018.

Travel awards for students in USA institutions in the amount of up to $1,000
will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis until completion of the
available funding.

We will accept applications for the student mentoring program with NSF travel
support (when applicable) until July 23, 2018.  Applications submitted after
July 23, 2018, but prior to ~~August 1, 2018~~ <span style="color:red">August 8, 2018</span>, will be still considered for the
student mentoring program but will not be considered for travel support.
