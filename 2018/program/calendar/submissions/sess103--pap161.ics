SUMMARY:SALaR: Scalable and Adaptive Designs for Large Message Reduction C
 ollectives
DESCRIPTION:SALaR: Scalable and Adaptive Designs for Large Message Reducti
 on Collectives\n\nBayatpour, Maqbool Hashmi, Chakraborty...\n\n\nMessage P
 assing Interface (MPI), thus far, has remained a dominant programming mode
 ls to program large-scale scientific applications. Collective communicatio
 n operations in MPI are of significant importance due to their communicati
 on intensive nature and use in scientific applications. With the emergence
  of multi-/many-core systems, and rise of deep learning applications, it i
 s important to revisit MPI collectives, particularly MPI Allreduce to expl
 oit vast parallelism offered by modern architectures. In this paper, we ta
 ke up this challenge and propose Scalable and Adaptive designs for Large m
 essage Reduction collectives (SALaR). We focus on MPI Allreduce due to its
  use in deep learning frameworks and propose new designs that can signific
 antly improve its performance by exploiting architectural features of mode
 rn multi-/many-cores in tandem with high- throughput network such as Infin
 iBand. We also propose a theoretical model to analyze communication and co
 mputation cost and use these insights to guide our designs. The evaluation
  of the proposed SALaR based designs shows significant performance gains o
 ver state-of-the-art designs on a wide variety of micro-benchmarks and app
 lications.
