SUMMARY:Self-Consumption Optimization of Renewable Energy Production in Di
 stributed Clouds
DESCRIPTION:Self-Consumption Optimization of Renewable Energy Production i
 n Distributed Clouds\n\nCamus, Blavette, Dufossé...\n\n\nThe growing appet
 ite of new technologies, such as Internet-of-Things, for Cloud resources l
 eads to an unprecedented energy consumption for these infrastructures. In 
 order to make these energy-hungry distributed systems more sustainable, Cl
 oud providers resort more and more to on-site renewable energy production 
 facilities like photovoltaic panels. Yet, this intermittent and variable e
 lectricity production is often uncorrelated with the Cloud consumption ind
 uced by its workload. Geographical load balancing, virtual machine (VM) mi
 gration and consolidation can be used to exploit multiple Cloud data cente
 rs’ locations and their associated photovoltaic panels for increasing thei
 r renewable energy consumption. However, these techniques cost energy and 
 network bandwidth, and this limits their utilization. In this paper, we pr
 opose to rely on the flexibility brought by Smart Grids to exchange renewa
 ble energy between distributed sites and thus, to further increase the ove
 rall Cloud’s self-consumption of the locally-produced renewable energy. Ou
 r solution is named SCORPIUS: Self-Consumption Optimization of Renewable e
 nergy Production In distribUted cloudS. It takes into account telecommunic
 ation network constraints and electrical grid requirements to optimize the
  Cloud’s self-consumption by trading-off between VM migration and renewabl
 e energy exchange. Our simulation-based results show that SCORPIUS outperf
 orms existing solutions on various workload traces of production Clouds in
  terms of both renewable self-consumption and overall energy consumption.
