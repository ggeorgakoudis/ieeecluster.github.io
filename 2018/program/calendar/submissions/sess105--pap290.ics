SUMMARY:A New Approach for Sparse Matrix Classification Based on Deep Lear
 ning Techniques
DESCRIPTION:A New Approach for Sparse Matrix Classification Based on Deep 
 Learning Techniques\n\nPichel, Pateiro-LÃ³pez\n\n\nIn this paper, a new met
 hodology to select the best storage format for sparse matrices based on de
 ep learning techniques is introduced. We focus on the selection of the pro
 per format for the sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), which is on
 e of the most important computational kernels in many scientific and engin
 eering applications. Our approach considers the sparsity pattern of the ma
 trices as an image, using the RGB channels to code several of the matrix p
 roperties. As a consequence, we generate image datasets that include enoug
 h information to successfully train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
 Considering GPUs as target platforms, the trained CNN selects the best sto
 rage format 90.1% of the time, obtaining 99.4% of the highest SpMV perform
 ance among the tested formats.
