SUMMARY:Unconventional Computing with Reconfigurable Devices in the Cloud
DESCRIPTION:Unconventional Computing with Reconfigurable Devices in the Cl
 oud\n\nBlott\n\n\nConventional von-Neumann architectures are suffering fro
 m rising power densities and performance scaling is slowing down with next
  generation technology nodes, while at the same time we are faced with an 
 explosion of data and sky-high compute requirements associated with the ro
 ll-out of machine learning algorithms. Reconfigurable logic with FPGAs can
  tailor the hardware to the application through customized datapaths and m
 emory architectures. Thereby FPGAs can achieve much higher energy efficien
 cies compared to conventional CPU- and GPU-based solutions. This has stimu
 lated interest in their exploitation within power-hungry data centers with
  recent benchmarks showing that FPGA-based application acceleration can br
 ing orders of magnitude improvement in regards to performance and performa
 nce per Watt compared to their counterparts. During this talk, we broadly 
 characterize a range of applications and explore how through these unconve
 ntional customized compute architectures new levels of performance scalabi
 lity and compute efficiency can be unleashed.
