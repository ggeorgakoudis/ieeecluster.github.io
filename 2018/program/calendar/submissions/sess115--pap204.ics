SUMMARY:Next Stop “NoOps": Enabling Cross-System Diagnostics Through Graph
 -based Composition of Logs and Metrics
DESCRIPTION:Next Stop “NoOps": Enabling Cross-System Diagnostics Through G
 raph-based Composition of Logs and Metrics\n\nZasadziński, Solé, Bran
 don...\n\n\nPerforming diagnostics in IT systems is an increasingly compli
 cated task, and it is not doable in satisfactory time by even most skillfu
 l operators. Systems and their architecture change very rapidly in respons
 e to business and user demand. Many organizations see value in the mainten
 ance and management model of NoOps that stands for No Operations. One of t
 he implementations of this model is a system that is maintained automatica
 lly without any human intervention. The path to NoOps involves not only pr
 ecise and fast diagnostics but also reusing as much knowledge as possible 
 after the system is reconfigured or changed. The biggest challenge is to l
 everage knowledge on one IT system and reuse this knowledge for diagnostic
 s of another, different system. We propose a framework of weighted graphs 
 which can transfer knowledge, and perform high-quality diagnostics of IT s
 ystems. We encode all possible data in a graph representation of a system 
 state and automatically calculate weights of these graphs. Then, thanks to
  the evaluation of similarity between graphs, we transfer knowledge about 
 failures from one system to another and use it for diagnostics. We success
 fully evaluate the proposed approach on Spark, Hadoop, Kafka and Cassandra
  systems.
