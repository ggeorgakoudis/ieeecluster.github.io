SUMMARY:Crossing the Chasm: How to develop weather and climate models for 
 next generation computers
DESCRIPTION:Crossing the Chasm: How to develop weather and climate models 
 for next generation computers\n\nMaynard\n\n\nEnergy constraints in proces
 sor design have led to radically different computer architectures than for
  example the ubiquitous x86 architecture. The newer generations of process
 ors are not faster but inherently more parallel. For scientific and numeri
 cal computing in general this poses a number of challenges. Rapidly evolvi
 ng hardware and the absence of a programming model in which to express thi
 s explosion of parallelism further compound these problems. This is partic
 ular acute for weather and climate codes which are large and complex, with
  many hundreds of thousands of lines of code, representing a significant i
 nvestment in scientific development and have long development cycles of a 
 decade or more. In this talk I will outline some approaches to this softwa
 re challenge, such as developing domain specific languages, being taken by
  several European groups to cross the chasm between our scientific aspirat
 ion to exploit Â Exascale computing and our ability to port, develop a
 nd adapt existing code to new architectures.
