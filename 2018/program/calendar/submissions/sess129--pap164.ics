SUMMARY:A Server-managed Transparent Object Storage Abstraction for HPC
DESCRIPTION:A Server-managed Transparent Object Storage Abstraction for HP
 C\n\nMu, Soumagne, Tang...\n\n\nOn the road to exascale, the high-performa
 nce computing (HPC) community is seeing the emergence of multi-tier storag
 e systems that take aim at the unprecedented amount of data being produced
  by scientific applications. Multi-tier storage in HPC systems take advant
 age of new technologies such as non-volatile memory, burst buffer, etc., a
 nd bring the benefit of increased I/O bandwidth. However, existing data ma
 nagement solutions for HPC applications, which were mainly developed for s
 ingle-tier storage, are no longer suitable at handling the increased level
  of complexity and currently delegate the task of handling deep memory hie
 rarchies back to the user. This presents programming challenges for applic
 ation developers and is an opportunity for defining new storage and I/O pa
 radigms. \nWe describe a novel object-based data abstraction that takes ad
 vantage of deep memory hierarchies by providing a simplified programming i
 nterface that enables autonomous, asynchronous, and transparent data movem
 ent with a server-driven architecture. Users can define a mapping between 
 application memory and these abstract storage objects, creating a linkage 
 between either all or part of an objectâ€™s content without making data copy
  or transfer calls, avoiding explicit management of complex data movement 
 across multiple storage hierarchies. We evaluate our system by storing pla
 sma physics simulation data with different storage layouts.
