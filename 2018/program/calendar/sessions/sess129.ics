SUMMARY:Paper session XV: Scalable Filesystems
DESCRIPTION:A Server-managed Transparent Object Storage Abstraction for HP
 C\n\nMu, Soumagne, Tang, Byna, Koziol...\n\nOn the road to exascale, the h
 igh-performance computing (HPC) community is seeing the emergence of multi
 -tier storage systems that take aim at the unprecedented amount of data be
 ing produced by scientific applications. Multi-tier storage in HPC systems
  take advantage of new technologies such as non-...\n\n-------------------
 --\nPDFE: Flexible Parallel State Machine Replication for Cloud Computing\
 n\nWu, Wu, Huang, Chen\n\nState machine replication (SMR) is a fundamental
  fault tolerant technique for distributed systems to guarantee consistency
  among replicas via sequential execution of commands. With the development
  of cloud computing, parallel SMR has been recently proposed for large sca
 le cloud datacenters. In this ...\n\n---------------------\nIOMiner: Large
 -scale Analytics Framework for Gaining Knowledge from I/O Logs\n\nWang, By
 na, Lockwood, Wright, Carns...\n\nModern HPC systems are collecting abunda
 nt I/O performance\ninstrumentation. The massive volume and heterogeneity\
 nof this instrumentation has made it difficult to\nperform in-depth integr
 ated analysis in a timely manner,\nhowever. To overcome this gap and to al
 low users to identify\nthe root causes of p...\n
