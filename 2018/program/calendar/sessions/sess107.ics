SUMMARY:Paper session IV: Generating and Optimizing Applications
DESCRIPTION:Whole Program Generation of Massively Parallel Shallow Water E
 quation Solvers\n\nKuckuk, KÃ¶stler\n\nThe study of ocean currents has been
  an active area of research for decades.\nAs a model close to the water su
 rface, the shallow water equations (SWE) can be used.\nFor realistic simul
 ations, efficient numerical solvers are necessary that exhibit a good node
 -level performance while still maintaining s...\n\n---------------------\n
 Modeling I/O performance variability using conditional variational auto en
 coders\n\nMadireddy, Balaprakash, Carns, Latham, Ross...\n\nStorage system
  performance modeling is crucial for \nefficient use of heterogeneous shar
 ed resources on leadership-class\ncomputers. \nVariability in application 
 performance, particularly variability arising\nfrom concurrent application
 s sharing I/O resources, \nis a major hurdle in the development of ac...\n
 \n---------------------\nOpenACC vs the Native Programming on Sunway Taihu
 Light: A Case Study with GTC-P\n\nCai, Wang, Lin\n\nSunway TaihuLight is C
 hina's recent top-ranked supercomputer worldwide that was the first to be 
 built entirely with home-grown processors. This supercomputer can be progr
 ammed with two approaches: directive-based OpenACC and native programming.
  These approaches are studied here using GTC-P, a partic...\n\n-----------
 ----------\nParallel Approximation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation fo
 r the Prediction of Large-Scale Geostatistics Simulations\n\nAbdulah, Ltai
 ef, Sun, Genton, Keyes\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation is an important st
 atistical technique for estimating missing data,  for example in climate a
 nd environmental applications, which are usually large and feature data po
 ints that are irregularly spaced. In particular, the Gaussian log-likeliho
 od function is the de facto mo...\n
