SUMMARY:Paper session V: Filesystems and Applications
DESCRIPTION:UniviStor: Integrated Hierarchical and Distributed Storage for
  HPC\n\nWang, Byna, Dong, Tang\n\nHigh performance computing (HPC) archite
 ctures have been adding new layers of storage, such as burst buffers to to
 lerate latency between memory and disk-based file systems.\nHowever, exist
 ing file system and burst buffer solutions typically manage each storage l
 ayer individually. Consequently, the bu...\n\n---------------------\nApply
 ing Pwrake Workflow System and Gfarm File System to Telescope Data Process
 ing\n\nTanaka, Tatebe, Kawashima\n\nIn this paper, we describe a use case 
 applying a scientific workflow system and a distributed file system to imp
 rove the performance of telescope data processing. The application is pipe
 line processing of data generated by Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) which is a fo
 cal plane camera mounted on the Subaru t...\n\n---------------------\nHIDS
 tore: A Hierarchical Intermediate Data Storage System for Seismic Processi
 ng Application\n\nWang, Zhao, Wang, Liu, Li...\n\nSeismic processing is an
  important technology in petroleum industry. During the execution of seism
 ic processing applications, large amount of intermediate data are generate
 d and accessed. Providing high-performance services for intermediate data 
 in the traditional storage architecture is expensive. ...\n\n-------------
 --------\nSciDP: Support HPC and Big Data Applications via Integrated Scie
 ntific Data Processing\n\nFeng, Sun, Yang, Zhou\n\nModern High Performance
  Computing (HPC) applications, such as Earth science simulations, produce 
 large amounts of data due to the surging of computing power, while big dat
 a applications have become more compute-intensive due to increasingly soph
 isticated analysis algorithms. The needs of both HPC an...\n
