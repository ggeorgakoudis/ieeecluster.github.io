SUMMARY:Paper session XII: Scheduling, Elasticity and Energy
DESCRIPTION:Elasticity in Graph Analytics? A Benchmarking Framework for El
 astic Graph Processing\n\nUta, Au, Ilyushkin, Iosup\n\nGraphs are a natura
 l fit for modeling concepts used in solving diverse problems in science, c
 ommerce, engineering, and governance. Responding to the diversity of graph
  data and algorithms, many parallel and distributed graph-processing syste
 ms exist. However, until now these platforms use a static m...\n\n--------
 -------------\nLeveraging Dependency in Scheduling and Preemption for High
  Throughput in Data-Parallel Clusters\n\nLiu, Shen, Sarker\n\nTask schedul
 ing and preemption are two important functions in data-parallel clusters. 
 Though directed acyclic graph task dependencies are common in data-paralle
 l clusters, previous task scheduling and preemption methods do not fully u
 tilize such task dependency to increase throughput since they simp...\n\n-
 --------------------\nSelf-Consumption Optimization of Renewable Energy Pr
 oduction in Distributed Clouds\n\nCamus, Blavette, Dufoss√©, Orgerie\n\nThe
  growing appetite of new technologies, such as Internet-of-Things, for Clo
 ud resources leads to an unprecedented energy consumption for these infras
 tructures. In order to make these energy-hungry distributed systems more s
 ustainable, Cloud providers resort more and more to on-site renewable ener
