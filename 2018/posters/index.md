IEEE Cluster 2018 is soliciting submissions from academia, laboratory, and
industry professionals to present their latest research findings and
works-in-progress in all aspects of cluster, cloud, and grid technologies in
the form of posters, which will be included in the conference proceedings.

The topics of interest are the same as in the
[Call for Papers.](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clusterposter2018)

## Submissions

Participants must submit a 2-page extended abstract (including references)
describing the poster content, and the research ideas in the poster. If
accepted, this extended abstract will be published in the proceedings of the
conference. Posters will be prominently displayed and presented during a
session in the conference. Additionally, posters will be made publicly
available on the conference website.

The extended abstract should be structured similar to a technical paper, and
may not exceed 2 letter-sized (8.5 x 11) pages including figures, tables and
references using the
[IEEE format](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
for conference proceedings (PDF, single-spaced, double column, 10pt text).

Please submit your poster via the [submission system.](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clusterposter2018)
