In this paper, we investigate the data access patterns
and file I/O behaviors of a production cosmology
appli-cation that uses the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
technique for its domain decomposition. This application
was originally developed using Hierarchical Data
Format (HDF version 4) I/O library and since HDF4
does not provide parallel I/O facilities, the global file
I/O operations were carried out by one of the allocated
processors. When the number of processors becomes
large, the I/O performance of this design degrades
significantly due to the high communication costs and
sequential file access. In this work, we present two
additional I/O implementations, using MPI-IO and
parallel HDF version 5, and analyze their impacts to
the I/O performance for this typical AMR application.
Based on the I/O patterns discovered in this application,
we also discuss the interaction between user level
parallel I/O operations and different parallel file systems
and point out the advantages and disadvantages.
The performance results presented in this work are obtained
from an SGI Origin2000 using XFS, an IBM
SP-2 using GPFS, and a Linux cluster using PVFS.
