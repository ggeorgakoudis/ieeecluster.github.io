Over the last decade, a dramatic increase has been observed in the ability to generate and store data in the course of parameter studies, performance analysis, and software testing. In this paper, we introduce ZENTURIO, a sophisticated experiment management environment
that greatly alleviates parameter studies, performance
analysis, and software testing for a wide variety of
target architectures, including cluster and Grid
architectures.

ZENTURIO uses a novel directive-based language named ZEN in
combination with a user portal
to specify arbitrary complex program executions. Among
others, ZEN enables to substitute strings,
to request for performance information, and to control the
number of experiments.
<P>
ZENTURIO has been designed as a collection of Grid services,
which comprise the following:
<P>
(1) a registry service which supports registering and
locating Grid services;
<P>
(2) an experiment generator that parses files with ZEN
directives and instruments applications
for performance analysis and parameter studies;
<P>
(3) an experiment manager that compiles and controls the
execution of experiments on the
target machine.
A graphical user portal allows the user to control and
monitor the experiments and to
automatically visualize performance and output data across
multiple experiments.
<P>
ZENTURIO has been implemented by employing Java/Jini
technologies and supports experiments on cluster
architectures via PBS and on Grid infrastructures
through Globus schedulers.
We report results of using ZENTURIO with an actual
performance analysis and parameter study
for a Globus site and a cluster architecture, respectively.
