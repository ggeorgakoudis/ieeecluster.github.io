A parallel file system is utilized  for supporting an
excessive file request resulted from a parallel application
in a cluster system. It uses traditional communication
protocols like TCP/IP or UDP/IP that were designed for Wide
Area Networks(WANs). For a cluster system, however, these
protocols are inappropriate for its large scale of network
overhead.

In accordance with this problem, we propose a Hybrid Channel
Model(HCM) for inter-cluster communication protocol. In a
parallel file system, messages can be classified as control
messages and file data block. Therefore, we divided a
message channel into two parts, a control message channel
and data channel. The first is used for transferring the
control messages, while the last is used for transferring
the file data blocks. For the message channel, TCP/IP is
used as a communication protocol, and Virtual Interface
Architecture(VIA) is used for data blocks.
