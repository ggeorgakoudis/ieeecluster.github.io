Designing scalable and efficient Message Passing
Interface (MPI)implementations for emerging cluster
interconnects such as VIA-based networks and
InfiniBand are important building next generation
clusters.  In this paper, we address the scalability
issue in the implementation of MPI over VIA by
on-demand connection management mechanism.
The on-demand connection management is
designed to limit the use of resources to what
applications absolutely require. Thus, the MPI
implementation ensures that resource usage
scales only as demanded by the application itself,
not the underlying system.

We address the design issues of incorporating the on-demand connection mechanism into an implementation
of MPI over VIA.  A complete implementation was done for
MVICH over both cLAN VIA and Berkeley VIA. Performance
evaluation on a set of microbenchmarks and NAS parallel
benchmarks demonstrates that the on-demand mechanism
 can increase the scalability of MPI implementations by
limiting the use of resources as needed by application.

Furthermore, performance evaluation also shows that the
on-demand mechanism delivers comparable performance
as the static mechanism in which a fully-connected process
model exists in MVICH over cLAN VIA. It even performs
better for certain applications. It performs better in
MVICH over Berkeley VIA on Myrinet. These results
demonstrate that the on-demand connection mechanism is a
feasible solution to increase the scalability of MPI
implementations over VIA- and InfiniBand-based networks.
