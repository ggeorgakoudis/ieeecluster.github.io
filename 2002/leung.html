Processor Allocation on Cplant: Achieving General Processor Locality Using One-Dimensional Allocation

The Computational Plant or Cplant
is a
commodity-based supercomputer under development
at Sandia National Laboratories.
This paper describes resource-allocation strategies
to achieve processor locality in Cplant and other
supercomputers.
Users of Cplant and other Sandia
supercomputers submit parallel jobs to a job queue.
When a job is scheduled to run, it is assigned to a set of
processors.
To obtain maximum throughput, jobs should be allocated to
localized
clusters of processors to minimize communication
costs and avoid bandwidth contention caused by overlappingjobs.

This paper introduces new allocation strategies and
performance
metrics based on space-filling curves and one dimensional
allocation
strategies.  These algorithms are general and simple.  Our
preliminary
results based on simulations and a Cplant implementation
indicate that
both space-filling curves and one-dimensional packing can
improve
processor locality.  These new allocation strategies are
implemented
in the new release of the Cplant System Software, Version
2.0.  This
version is being phased into the Cplant systems at Sandia in
April
2002.
