Memory Mapped Networks: A New Deal for Distributed Shared Memories?

Distributed Shared Memories performance has always suffered
from high network latencies and software communication
layers with a large overhead. Memory mapped networks such
as Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) allow to reliably
access remote memory without involving the operating system.

SCI provides both PIO (Programmed IO) with very low latency
and RDMA (Remote DMA) for bulk transfers. To show how DSM
systems can benefit from these techniques, we have developed
SciFS, a DSM tightly integrated with the operating system,
that exploits the high performance and the remote memory
access capabilities of SCI.
We first show the respective advantages of PIO and RDMA.
Then, we describe how to build a scalable page transfer
mechanism by mixing PIO and RDMA. Despite the lack of a
broadcast mechanism with SCI, we demonstrate that it is
possible to build scalable synchronization primitives
using PIO.
Finally, we evaluate various consistency models with
scientific computing applications from the Splash benchmark.
We observe that, even if the rough network performance is
good, it is not sufficient to obtain acceptable results with
applications that require fine grain parallelism. However,
we show that memory mapped networks provide an efficient
hardware support to implement software DSM systems without
requiring complex relaxed consistency models. This way, DSM
design can be greatly simplified using this technology.
