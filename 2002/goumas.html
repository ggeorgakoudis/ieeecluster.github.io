This paper presents a complete
end-to-end framework to
generate
automatic message-passing code for tiled iteration spaces.
It
considers general parallelepiped  tiling transformations and
general convex iteration spaces. We achieve to address all
problems concerning data parallel code generation
efficiently by
transforming the initial non-rectangular tile to a
rectangular
one. In this way, data distribution and communication become
simple and straightforward. We have implemented our
parallelizing
techniques in a tool which automatically generates MPI code
and
run several experiments on a cluster of PCs. Our
experimental
results show the merit of general parallelepiped tiling
transformations, and confirm previous theoretical work on
scheduling-optimal tile shapes.
