We describe the use of a cluster as a generalized facility
for development.  A development facility is a system used
primarily for testing and development activites while
being operated reliably for many users.  We are in the
midst of a project to build and operate a large-scale
development testbed.  We discuss our motivation for
using clusters in this way and compare the model to a
classic computing facility.  We describe our experiences
and findings from the first phase of this project.  Many
of these observations are relevant to the design of
standard clusters and to future development facilities.
