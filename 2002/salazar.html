We present a new parallelization technique that
significantly improves performance of certain
data-parallel algorithms on heterogeneous clusters of
workstations. The two main goals of our technique are to
improve execution times (compared to traditional
parallelization techniques) and to efficiently use the
computing resources available in the cluster.
The technique is based on a pre-processing phase where
 information about the cluster capacity is obtained,
a load balanced data decomposition is derived,
and information is generated to guide the cluster node
 utilization during the execution of the parallel
 algorithm. We applied our technique to
Gaussian Elimination and Pair Wise Interaction problems,
the experiments show speedup improvements
up to 133% and 275% respectively and the cluster
utilization efficiency improves up to 180% and 300%
when compared with traditional parallelization techniques.
