<P>With
applications becoming larger and the increasing load on
high-performance systems, it is important to tackle the I/O
bottleneck
problem from several angles. It is not only essential to
optimize
the I/O accesses of any one application, but also to be able
to
identify and exploit opportunities resulting from the
sharing of
datasets across applications.
Clusters are rapidly becoming the
platform of choice for demanding applications due to their
cost-effectiveness
and widespread deployment.
Consequently, this paper attempts to optimize data sharing
across
applications concurrently executing on the cluster.
Specifically, we propose and implement a kernel-level
caching module
at each node of a Linux cluster that can be used to service
several
processes of different applications. Using detailed
evaluations on an
actual Linux cluster, this paper demonstrates the benefitsof this
module in optimizing intra and inter-application I/O
requests.
