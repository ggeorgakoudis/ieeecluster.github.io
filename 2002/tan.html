With dramatic improvem
ents in cost-performance, the use of
clusters of personal computers is fast becoming
widespread. For ease of use and management, a Single System
Image (SSI) is highly desirable. There are several
approaches that one can take to achieve SSI. In this paper,
we discuss the achievement of SSI via the use of the user
login shell. To this end, we describe shoc (Shell over a
Cluster) \226 an implementation of the standard Linux-GNU bash
shell that permits the user to utilize a cluster as a
single resource. In addition, shoc provides for transparent
pre-emptive load balancing without requiring the user to
rewrite, recompile or even relink her applications. Running
t user-level, shoc do not require any kernel modification
and currently runs on any Linux cluster fulfilling a
minimal set of requirements. We will also present results
on the performance of shoc and show that the load balancing
feature gives rise to better overall cluster utilization as
well as improvement in response time for individual
processes.
