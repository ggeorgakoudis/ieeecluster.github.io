It is extremely important to minimize network access time
in constructing a high-performance PC cluster system.  For
an SCI-based PC cluster, it is possible to reduce the
network access time by maintaining network cache in each
cluster node.  This paper presents the second version CC-
NUMA card (CC-NUMA card II) that utilizes network cache for
SCI-based PC clustering.  The CC-NUMA card II is directly
plugged into the PCI slot of each node, and contains shared
memory, network cache, shared memory control module and
network control module.  The network cache is maintained
for the shared memory on the PCI bus of cluster nodes.  The
coherency mechanism between the network cache and the
shared memory is based on the IEEE SCI standard.  As a
former research, the first version CC-NUMA card (CC-NUMA
card I) was developed.  The CC-NUMA card I adopting a
Dolphin\241\257s PCI-SCI card as the network control module
caused overhead in exchanging data between the remote
nodes.  In this paper, the overhead is removed by
developing the CC-NUMA card II that combines the shared
memory control module and the network control module in a
single card.  Throughout the experiment with the SPLASH-2
benchmark suite, the CC-NUMA card II based PC cluster shows
better performance than a NUMA system based on Dolphin\241\257s
PCI-SCI card.
