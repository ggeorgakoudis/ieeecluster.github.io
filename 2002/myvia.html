Virtual Interface Architecture (VIA) established a
communication model with low latency and high bandwidth,
defined the standard of user-level high-performance
communication specification in cluster system. This paper
analyzes the current development, principle and
implementations of VIA, and presents a user-level
high-performance communication software MyVIA based on
Myrinet, which is comfortable with VIA specification. The
paper first describes the design principle and framework of
MyVIA, and then proposes new technologies for MyVIA which
include User TLB, continued host physical memory and varied
NIC buffer, the pipelining communication based on resource
and DMA chain, physical descriptor ring and dynamic cache.
Experimental results of performance compare and analysis are
presented, and the bandwidth of MyVIA for 4KB message is
250MB/s, the lowest one-way latency is 8.46us, which shows
the performance of MyVIA surpassed that of other
implementations of
VIA.
