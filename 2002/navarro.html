When systems a
dministration activities need to be performed
100s or 1000s of times, cluster administrators look for
ways of automating them.  For example, automating Linux
installation and configuration often involves using network
services like DHCP and TFTP to configure network interfaces
and deliver a boot image, and protocols like FTP, HTTP,
and NFS to server files used in the build and configuration
process.  Combining these and other network services with
remote power and console, cluster administrators can
automate many administrative tasks. Scalable Cluster
Administration addresses the challenge: what architectures
and techniques can cluster designers use to automate
cluster administration on very large clusters?  In this
paper we will describe an approach we used in the Math &
omputer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory on
Chiba City, a 314-node Linux cluste. We will analyze the
scalability, flexibility, and reliability benefits and
limitations of our approach, and present ideas we are
exploring to address these limitations.
