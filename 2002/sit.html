Cluster-based web servers are a popular approach to
achieving high performance for the ever-growing web traffic.
Most existing systems use a Layer 4 dispatcher to assign
client requests to the web server nodes. Some content-based
dispatching solutions need to parse the HTTP request in
order to make the dispatching decision. They either can
achieve only coarse-grain load balancing or would introduce
heavy load on the dispatcher. Cooperative caching allows the
requested document to be fetched from a peer server node\222s
in-memory cache, rather than from the local hard disk. While
this can greatly improve the performance, it consumes much
network resources when transferring large cache objects. In
this paper, we present a new network support mechanism,
called Socket Cloning (SC), in which an opened socket can be
migrated efficiently between cluster nodes. With SC, the
processing of HTTP requests can be moved to the node that
has a cached copy of the requested document, thus bypassing
any object transfer between peer servers. A prototype has
been implemented and micro-benchmark tests show that SC
incurs much less overhead than all the mentioned approaches
for any file size. In trace-driven benchmark tests, our
system can outperform other approaches by
90%.
