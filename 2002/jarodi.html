In this paper
 we introduce an agent-based infrastructure
that provides a set of generic software services and
functions for developing and deploying different high
performance programming models and applications on clusters
using Java. A prototype system, based on this architecture,
has been developed. Since this system is written completely
in Java, it is portable and allows running programs in
parallel across multiple heterogeneous platforms. With the
agent-based infrastructure, users need not deal with the
mechanisms of deploying and loading user classes on the
heterogeneous cluster, while details of scheduling,
controlling, monitoring, and running user jobs are hidden.
In addition, the management of the system resources is made
transparent to the user. Such uniform services, when
rendered available in a ubiquitous manner, are essential for
facilitating the development and deployment of scalable high
performance Java on clusters.  An initial deployment over a
heterogeneous, distributed cluster results in significantly
enhanced relative performance; absolute performance compared
to C (MPI) improves with increased granularity of the
algorithm.
