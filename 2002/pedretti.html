In this paper, we
describe additions and modifications to
the Computational Plantsystem software to support
multi-processor compute nodes and to support heterogeneous
node types. We describe how these capabilities have been
incorporated into our scalable runtime system and how these
changes affect the interface seen by end users and
application developers.  We also discuss several important
operating system and networking issues that can directly
impact application performance.  We present some initial
performance metrics that indicate how our current
implementation scales when multiple processes are running
on a single node.
