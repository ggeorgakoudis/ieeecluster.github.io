A distributed Java
 Virtual Machine (DJVM) running across
multiple cluster nodes provides a true parallel execution
environment for performing multi-threaded Java applications
in a distributed environment. While there are several
prototypes of DJVMs ever implemented, the approach of using
Just-in-Time compiler (JIT) in a DJVM was little explored in
the literature. Most existing DJVMs, while supporting some
forms of migratability, usually suffer from the slow Java
interpreter execution and may not be efficient enough for
solving computation-intensive problems. In this paper we
present JESSICA2, new DJVM running in JIT mode that can run
multi-threaded Java applications transparently on clusters
with an single system image (SSI) illusion. JESSICA2
implemented a cluster-aware Java execution engine, which
allows Java threads to be migrated in JIT mode for purpose
of dynamic load balancing. In this paper, we explain the
issues surrounding thread migration in a JIT compilation
environment and show that it can greatly help DJVM for
achieving high performance. In addition, JESSICA2 achieves
SSI by hiding all the distributed object accesses with a
global object space (GOS), which frees the user from caring
about the physical location on which a Java thread is
running. The object-oriented implementation of GOS satisfies
the memory constrains in current Java Memory Model and
effectively exploits the Java semantics to reduce the object
access overheads in the distributed environments. An
adaptive migrating-home protocol used in GOS is introduced.
JESSICA2 has been implemented on an 8-node x86-based Linux
clusters. Significant performance improvement over JESSICA
was
observed.
