Admission and congestion control mechanisms are
integral parts of any Quality of Service (QoS) design for
networks that support integrated traffic.
While an admission control algorithm helps in delivering
the assured performance, a congestion control algorithm
regulates traffic injection to avoid network saturation.
In this paper, we propose an
admission control algorithm and a congestion control
algorithm for clusters,
which are increasingly being used in a diverse set of
applications that require QoS guarantees.
The uniqueness of our approach is that we develop these
algorithms for wormhole-switched networks, which have been
used in designing clusters.
We use QoS-capable wormhole routers and QoS-capable
network interface cards (NICs), referred to as Host Channel
Adapters (HCAs) in InfiniBand Architecture (IBA),
to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms.
The admission control is applied at the HCAs and the
routers, while the congestion control is deployed only at
the HCAs. A mixed workload consisting of
best effort, real-time, and control traffic is used to
investigate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.
<P>
Simulation results with a single router (8-port) cluster
and a 2-D mesh network cluster indicate that the
admission and congestion control algorithms are quite
effective
in delivering the assured performance.
The proposed
credit-based congestion control algorithm is simple
and practical in that it relies on hardware already
available
in the HCA/NIC to regulate traffic injection.
