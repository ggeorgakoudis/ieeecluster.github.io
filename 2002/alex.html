This paper describes a nov
el distributed data parallel SCF
algorithm and the CPHF step of an analytic
Hessian algorithm. The distinguishing features of these
algorithms are: (a) columns of density and
Fock matrices are distributed among processors, (b)
pair-wise dynamic load balancing and efficient
static load balancer were developed to achieve an good
workload, (c) network communication time is
minimized via careful analysis of data flow in the SCF and
CPHF algorithms. By using a shared
memory model, novel work load balancers, and improved
analytic Hessian steps, we have developed
codes that achieve superb performance. The performance of
these codes is demonstrated on large
biological systems.
