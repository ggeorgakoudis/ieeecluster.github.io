This paper describes an object-oriented software
architecture for cluster integration and management
that enables extensibility, portability, and scalability.
This architecture has been successfully implemented and
deployed on several large-scale production clusters at
Sandia National Laboratories, the largest of which is
currently 1861 nodes.  This paper discusses the key
features of the architecture that allow for easily
extending the range of supported hardware devices and
network topologies.  We also describe in detail how the
object-oriented structure that represents the hardware
components can be used to implement scalable and portable
cluster management tools.
