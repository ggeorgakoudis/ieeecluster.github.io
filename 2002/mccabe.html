Offloading protocol processing
will become an important tool
in supporting our efforts to deliver increasing bandwidth to
applications.  In this paper we describe our experience in
offloading protocol processing to a programmable gigabit
Ethernet network interface card.  For our experiments, we
selected a simple RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send)
protocol called RMPP (Reliable Message Passing Protocol).
This protocol provides end-to-end flow control and full
message retransmit in the case of a lost or corrupt packet.
By carefully selecting parts of the protocol for offloading,we were able to improve the bandwidth delivered to MPI
applications from approximately 280 Mb/s to approximately
700
Mb/s using standard, 1500 byte, Ethernet frames.  Using
``jumbo'', 9000 byte, frames the bandwidth improves from
approximately 425 Mb/s to 840 Mb/s.  Moreover, we were able
to
show a significant increase in the availability of the host
processor.
