High speed bulk data transfer is an important part of many
data-intensive scientific applications. This paper describes
an aggressive bulk data transfer scheme, called Reliable
Blast UDP (RBUDP), intended for extremely high bandwidth,
dedicated- or Quality-of-Service- enabled networks, such as
optically switched networks. This paper also provides an
analytical model to predict RBUDP\222s performance and compares
the results of our model against our implementation of
RBUDP. Our results show that RBUDP performs extremely
efficiently over high speed dedicated networks and our model
is able to provide good estimates of its
performance.
