We present a novel twist to the Beowulf cluster--the Bladed Beowulf (BB).  In contrast to traditional
Beowulfs which typically use Intel or AMD processors,
our Bladed Beowulf uses Transmeta processors in order
to keep power dissipation low and reliability high
while still achieving comparable performance to Intel-
and AMD-based clusters.

Given the ever increasing complexity of traditional
supercomputers and Beowulf clusters; the issues of size,
reliability, power consumption, and ease of administration
with be ``the'' issues of this decade for high-performance
computing.  Bigger and faster machines are simply not
good enough anymore.  To illustrate, we present the
results of  performance benchmarks on our Bladed Beowulf
and introduce two performance metrics that contribute to
the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a computing system--performance/power and performance/space.
