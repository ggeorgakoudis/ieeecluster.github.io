I-Cluster is an HP Lab
oratories Grenoble initiative in
collaboration with the ID-IMAG laboratory of INRIA
Rh\364ne-Alpes. The aim of this research programme is to
develop a production environment for idle computing power
over an intranet. To be more precise, I-Cluster enables
automatic real-time analysis of the availability,
configuration and workload of machines on an intranet. When
instantiation of a supercomputing function is carried out by
a user, I-Cluster determines the most appropriate cluster
for carrying out this function, allocates the machines and
then begins distributed computing. To obtain this result,
I-Cluster possesses a "sandbox" on each workstation on the
intranet, enabling it to use the computing resources of
these machines during idle periods. This document presents
the sandbox developed for I-Cluster and its features.
