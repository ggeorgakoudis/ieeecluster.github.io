We describe the design, implementation, and validation of
the communication infrastructure (CI) for fault-tolerant
cluster middleware.  The CI supports and provides optimized
interfaces for two distinct classes of communication:  for
the applications and for the cluster management
middleware.  The CI is designed for portability and for
efficient operation on top of modern user-level message
passing mechanisms.  We present a functional fault model
for the CI and show how platform-specific faults map to
this fault model.  We have developed a fault injection
scheme based on the fault model.  This scheme is integrated
with the CI and is thus portable across different
communication technologies.  The CI and the associated
fault injection scheme have been implemented as part of a
larger fault-tolerant cluster project.  The fault injection
scheme is used to validate and evaluate the implementation
of the CI itself as well as the cluster management
middleware in the presence of communication faults.
