We present the work that extends
our previous Myrinet port
for LAM/MPI, MPI-NP, with collective communication
primitives on the NIC. This work is another step in our
experiment of making the NIC  MPI aware. We believe that an
MPI aware control program on the NIC can deliver a richer
set of performance enhancements, not restricted to just the
better bandwidth/latency,  to MPI applications. MPI
collective communication involves considerable interactions
between the communication subsystems of the nodes that are
not of any direct interest to the application. By migrating
these talkative components to the Myrinet Network Interface
Card we allow this dialog between the nodes to happen with
minimum latency. We explore the advantage of supporting
several MPI collective communication routines on the NIC.
These include MPI_Bcast(), MPI_Barrier() and
MPI_Comm_Create().
