Distributed Computing Systems are a viable and less
expensive alternative to
parallel computers. However, a serious difficulty in
concurrent programming
of a distributed
system is how to deal with scheduling and load balancing of
such a system,
which may consist of heterogeneous computers.
Distributed scheduling schemes suitable for parallel loops
with independent iterations
on heterogeneous computer clusters have been proposed and
analyzed in the past.
This paper deals with the scalability of the centralized
distributed loop scheduling schemes. We propose
a hierarchical version and demonstrate that it is scalable.
We compare the new 
version with an existing scalable
scheme (Tree scheduling). We provide implementations in both
MPI and CORBA.
