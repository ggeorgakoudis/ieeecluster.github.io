Most high performance scientific applications
require efficient support for collective communication.
Point-to-point message-passing communication in current
generation
clusters are based on Send/Recv communication model.
Collective
communication operations built on top of such point-to-point
message-passing operations might achieve suboptimal
performance.
VIA and the emerging InfiniBand support remote DMA
operations.
Such operations not only allow data to be moved between the
nodes
with low overhead, they also allow to create and provide a
logical shared
memory address space across the nodes. This feature
is valuable for implementing high performance and scalable
collective
operations. In this paper, we focus on barrier, probably the
most
frequently used collective operation. We demonstrate how
RDMA write
operations can be used to support inter-node barrier in a
cluster
with SMP nodes. We also propose a scheme to exploit the
shared memory
within a SMP node to support fast intra-node barrier.
Combining these two schemes, we developed an overall
barrier scheme for cluster of SMP nodes with cLAN VIA
interconnect.Compared to the current barrier algorithms
using
send/recv communication model, the new approach is shown
to reduce barrier latency on a 64 processor (32 dual nodes)
system by up to 66 percent.
