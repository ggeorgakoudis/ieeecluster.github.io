An Architecture for Integrated Resource Management of MPI Jobs

We present a new architecture for the integration of
distributed resource management systems and parallel
run-time environments such as MPI.  The architecture solves
the long-standing problem of achieving a tight integration
between the two in a clean and robust manner that fully
enables the functionality of both systems, including
resource limit enforcement and accounting. We also present
a more uniform command interface to the user, which
simplifies the task of running parallel jobs and tools
under a resource manager. The architecture is extensible
and allows new systems to be incorporated.  We describe the
properties that a resource management system must have to
work in this architecture, and find that these are
ubiquitous in the resource management world.  Using the Sun
(TM) Cluster Runtime Environment, we show the generality of
the approach by implementing tight integrations with PBS,
LSF, and Sun Grid Engine, and we demonstrate the advantages
of a tight integration.  No modifications or enhancements
to these resource management systems were required, which
is in marked contrast to ad-hoc approaches which typically
require such changes.
