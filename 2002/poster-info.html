Information for Poster Presenters
</b></font size>
</center>
<P>


Posters will be presented on easels provided by the hotel.
We will provide a 40x60" foam board that you
can use, or you may mount your poster on your own foam (or any other
suitable support infrastructure).  The plan is to have the 60"
dimension be horizontal.  If you do your own mounting, please do not
exceed this dimension!  We will also provide tape and pins for putting
things on the foam boards.


We will supply single-page banners to identify your poster
location; unfortunately, there is no easy way to mount a full width
banner on an easel.  This means that you should provide your own title
on the poster so that it is readable from a short distance.


If you need power and/or network connections, contact the posters chair,
Ricky Kendall by e-mail at <a href="mailto:rickyk@ameslab.gov">rickyk@ameslab.gov</a> or by phone at 515-294-9294.
