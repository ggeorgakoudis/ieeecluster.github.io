Protocol-Dependent Message-Passing Performance on Linux Clusters
<br>

In Linux clusters, as in any multi-processor system,
the inter-processor communication rate is the major limiting factor
to its general usefulness.  This research is geared toward
improving the communication performance by identifying where the
inefficiencies
lie and trying to understand their cause.  The NetPIPE
utility is
being used to compare the latency and throughput of all
current
message-passing libraries for a variety of hardware
configurations.
