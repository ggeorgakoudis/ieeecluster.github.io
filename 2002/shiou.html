In modern clustering environments where memory hierarchy has many layers (distributed memory, shared memory layer, cache, etc.), an important question is how to fully utilize all
available resources and identify the most dominant layer in
certain computation.  When combining algorithms on all
layers together, what would be the best method to get the
best performance out of all the resources we have?

Mixed mode programming model that uses thread programming on
the shared memory layer and message passing programming on
the distributed memory layer is a method that many
researchers are using to utilize the memory resources.  In
this paper, we take an algorithmic approach that uses matrix
multiplication as a tool to show how cache algorithms
affect the performance of both shared memory and istributed
memory algorithms.  It is also important to consider the
underlying sequential component of the algorithm; in fact
not doing so may be misleading and simply combining shared
memory and distributed memory algorithms could lead to
incorrect
conclusions.
