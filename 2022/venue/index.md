          <b>COVID-19 Announcement</b><br><br>
          The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of IEEE Cluster 2021 into an all-digital conference experience – IEEE Cluster 2021 will now be an online event. <b>Therefore, IEEE Cluster 2021 will no longer take place in Portland, Oregon, USA and will instead take place virtually</b>. The conference dates remain the same – September 7-10, 2021. Proceedings will not be cancelled, and publications will continue as planned. For questions, contact the Virtual Arrangements Chairs.
