SUMMARY:Efficient Algorithms for the Summed Area Tables Primitive on GPUs
DESCRIPTION:Efficient Algorithms for the Summed Area Tables Primitive on G
 PUs\n\nchen, Wahib, Takizawa...\n\n\nTwo-dimensional Summed Area Tables (S
 AT) is a fundamental primitive used in image processing and machine learni
 ng applications. We present a collection of optimization methods for compu
 ting SAT on CUDA-enabled GPUs. Conventional approaches rely on computing t
 he prefix sum in one dimension in parallel, transposing the matrix, then c
 omputing the prefix sum for the other dimension in parallel. Additionally,
  conventional methods use the scratchpad memory as cache. We propose a col
 lection of algorithms that are scalable with respect to problem size. We u
 se the register cache technique instead of the scratchpad memory and also 
 employ a naive serial scan on the thread level for computing the prefix su
 m for one of the dimensions. Using a novel transpose-in-registers method w
 e increase the inter-thread parallelism and outperform conventional SAT im
 plementations. In addition, we significantly reduce both the communication
  between threads and the number of arithmetic instructions. On an Nvidia P
 ascal P100 GPU and Volta V100, our evaluations demonstrate that our implem
 entations outperform state of the art libraries and yield up to 2.3x and 3
 .2x speedup over OpenCV and Nvidia NPP libraries, respectively.
