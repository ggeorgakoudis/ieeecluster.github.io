SUMMARY:Programmability, Portability and Performance: Challenges and Oppor
 tunities in Enabling Usable Systems in the Exascale Era
DESCRIPTION:Programmability, Portability and Performance: Challenges and O
 pportunities in Enabling Usable Systems in the Exascale Era\n\nOâ€™Brien\n\n
 \nIBM recently assumed 1st and 3rd position on the Top 500 with the DOE CO
 RAL Summit and Sierra systems respectively. This achievement represents th
 e culmination of a strong technical collaboration between various groups w
 ithin IBM as well as the CORAL partners. In this talk I will discuss the c
 hallenges and opportunities encountered in the course of building a CORAL 
 programming environment to address the critical requirements of Programmab
 ility, Performance and Portability. I will also briefly look forward to th
 e ongoing challenges in evolving these programming environment beyond pure
 ly HPC, to address the broader and ubiquitous requirements of machine lear
 ning applications.
