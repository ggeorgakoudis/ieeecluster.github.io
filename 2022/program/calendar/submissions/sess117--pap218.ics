SUMMARY:Optimizing Distributed Data-Intensive Workflows
DESCRIPTION:Optimizing Distributed Data-Intensive Workflows\n\nFriese, Tal
 lent, Schram...\n\n\nWe present techniques for optimizing the performance 
 of data-intensive workflows that execute on geographically distributed and
  heterogeneous resources. We optimize for both throughput and response tim
 e. Optimizing for throughput, we alleviate data-transfer bottlenecks. To h
 ide access times of accessing remote data, we transparently introduce pref
 etching (overlapping data transfer and computation), without changing work
 flow source code. Optimizing for response time, we introduce intelligent s
 cheduling for a set of high-priority tasks. We replace a greedy scheduler 
 that assigns tasks without accounting for differing performance on heterog
 eneous resources, leading to long latencies. Intelligent scheduling rapidl
 y selects a near-optimal solution for a bi-objective optimization problem.
  One objective is a good task assignment; the other objective is minimize 
 I/O contention by distributing load across resources and time. To reason a
 bout task completion times, we use modeling tools to generate accurate pre
 dictions of execution times. We show performance results for Belle II work
 flow for high energy physics. The combination of these techniques can impr
 ove throughput over production Belle II configurations by 20-40%. Our work
  is general and adaptable to other distributed workflows.
