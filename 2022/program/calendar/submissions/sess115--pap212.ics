SUMMARY:A Methodology for Characterizing the Correspondence Between Real a
 nd Proxy Applications
DESCRIPTION:A Methodology for Characterizing the Correspondence Between Re
 al and Proxy Applications\n\nAaziz, Cook, Cook...\n\n\nProxy applications 
 are a simplified means for stakeholders to evaluate how both hardware and 
 software stacks might perform on the class of real applications that they 
 are meant to model. However, characterizing the re- lationship between the
 m and their behavior is not an easy task. We present a data-driven methodo
 logy for characterizing the relationship between real and proxy applicatio
 ns based on collecting runtime data from both and then using data analytic
 s to find their correspondence and divergence. We use new capabilities for
  application-level monitoring within LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Monitor
 ing System) to cap- ture hardware performance counter and MPI-related data
 . To demonstrate the utility of this methodology, we present experimental 
 evidence from two system platforms, using four proxy applications from the
  current ECP Proxy Application Suite and their corresponding parent applic
 ations (in the ECP application portfolio). Results show that each proxy an
 alyzed is representative of its parent with respect to computation and mem
 ory behavior. We also analyze communication patterns separately using mpiP
  data and show that communication for these four proxy/parent pairs is als
 o similar.
