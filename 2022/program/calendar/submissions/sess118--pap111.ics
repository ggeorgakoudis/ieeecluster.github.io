SUMMARY:Fixed-PSNR Lossy Compression for Scientific Data
DESCRIPTION:Fixed-PSNR Lossy Compression for Scientific Data\n\nTao, Di, L
 iang...\n\n\nError-controlled lossy compression has been studied for years
  because of extremely large volumes of data being produced by today’s scie
 ntific simulations. None of existing lossy compressors, however, allow use
 rs to fix the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) during compression, althou
 gh PSNR has been considered as one of the most significant indicators to a
 ssess compression quality. In this paper, we propose a novel technique pro
 viding a fixed-PSNR lossy compression for scientific data sets. We impleme
 nt our proposed method based on the SZ lossy compression framework and rel
 ease the code as an open-source toolkit. We evaluate our fixed-PSNR compre
 ssor on three real world high-performance computing data sets. Experiments
  show that our solution has a high accuracy in controlling PSNR, with an a
 verage deviation of 0.1 ∼ 5.0 dB on the tested data sets.
