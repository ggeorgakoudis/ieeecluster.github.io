SUMMARY:Parallel Approximation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for th
 e Prediction of Large-Scale Geostatistics Simulations
DESCRIPTION:Parallel Approximation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation fo
 r the Prediction of Large-Scale Geostatistics Simulations\n\nAbdulah, Ltai
 ef, Sun...\n\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation is an important statistical 
 technique for estimating missing data,  for example in climate and environ
 mental applications, which are usually large and feature data points that 
 are irregularly spaced. In particular, the Gaussian log-likelihood functio
 n is the de facto model, which operates on the resulting sizable dense cov
 ariance matrix. The advent of high-performance systems with advanced compu
 ting power and memory capacity have enabled full simulations only for rath
 er small dimensional climate problems, solved at the machine precision acc
 uracy. The challenge for high dimensional problems lies in the computation
  requirements of the log-likelihood function, which necessitates O(n^2) st
 orage and  O(n^3) operations, where n represents the number of given spati
 al locations. This prohibitive computational cost may be reduced by using 
 approximation techniques that not only enable large-scale simulations othe
 rwise intractable but also maintain the accuracy and the fidelity of the s
 patial statistics model. In this paper, we extend the Exascale GeoStatisti
 cs software (i.e., ExaGeoStat) to support the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) approxim
 ation, which exploits the data sparsity of the dense covariance matrix by 
 compressing the off-diagonal tiles up to a user-defined accuracy threshold
 . The underlying linear algebra operations may then be carried out on this
  data compression format, which may ultimately reduce the arithmetic compl
 exity of the maximum likelihood estimation and the corresponding memory fo
 otprint. Performance results of TLR-based computations on shared and distr
 ibuted-memory systems attain up to 13X and 5X speedups,  respectively, com
 pared to full accuracy simulations using synthetic and real datasets (up t
 o 2M), while ensuring adequate prediction accuracy.
