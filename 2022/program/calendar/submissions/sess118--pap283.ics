SUMMARY:Harmonia: An Interference-Aware Dynamic I/O Scheduler for Shared N
 on-Volatile Burst Buffers
DESCRIPTION:Harmonia: An Interference-Aware Dynamic I/O Scheduler for Shar
 ed Non-Volatile Burst Buffers\n\nKougkas, Devarajan, Sun...\n\n\nModern HP
 C systems employ burst buffer installations to reduce the peak I/O require
 ments for external storage and deal with the burstiness of I/O in modern s
 cientific applications.  These I/O buffering resources are shared between 
 multiple applications that run concurrently. This leads to severe performa
 nce degradation due to contention, a phenomenon called cross-application I
 /O interference. In this paper, we first explore the negative effects of i
 nterference at the burst buffer layer and we present two new metrics that 
 can quantitatively describe the slowdown applications experience due to in
 terference. We introduce Harmonia, a new dynamic I/O scheduler that is awa
 re of interference, adapts to the underlying system, implements a new 2-wa
 y decision-making process and employs several scheduling policies to maxim
 ize the system efficiency and applications' performance. Our evaluation sh
 ows that Harmonia, through better I/O scheduling, can outperform by 3x exi
 sting state-of-the-art buffering management solutions and can lead to bett
 er resource utilization.
