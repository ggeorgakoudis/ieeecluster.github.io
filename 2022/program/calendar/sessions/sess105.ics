SUMMARY:Paper session II: Matrix algorithms
DESCRIPTION:Load-balancing-aware Parallel Algorithms of H-matrices with Ad
 aptive Cross Approximation for GPUs\n\nHOSHINO, IDA, HANAWA, NAKAJIMA\n\nH
 ierarchical matrices (H-matrices) are an approximation technique for dense
  matrices, such as the coefficient matrix of the Boundary Element Method (
 BEM). An H-matrix is expressed by a set of low-rank approximated and small
  dense sub-matrices, each of which has various rank, of the dense matrix.

 gy to select the best storage format for sparse matrices based on deep lea
 rning techniques is introduced. We focus on the selection of the proper fo

 he most important computational kernels in many ...\n
