SUMMARY:Paper session IX: Graphs and Big Data Analytics
DESCRIPTION:A Scalable Distributed Louvain Algorithm for Large-scale Graph
  Community Detection\n\nZeng, Yu\n\nWe present a new distributed community
  detection algorithm for large graphs based on the Louvain method. We expl
 oit a distributed delegate partitioning to ensure the workload and communi
 cation balancing among processors. In addition, we design a new heuristic 
 strategy to carefully coordinate the com...\n\n---------------------\nOpti
 mizing Distributed Data-Intensive Workflows\n\nFriese, Tallent, Schram, Ha
 lappanavar, Barker\n\nWe present techniques for optimizing the performance
  of data-intensive workflows that execute on geographically distributed an
 d heterogeneous resources. We optimize for both throughput and response ti
 me. Optimizing for throughput, we alleviate data-transfer bottlenecks. To 
 hide access times of acces...\n\n---------------------\nComputing Exact Ve
 rtex Eccentricity on Massive-scale Distributed Graphs\n\nIwabuchi, Sanders
 , Henderson, Pearce\n\nThe eccentricity of a vertex is defined as the leng
 th of the longest shortest path to any other vertex. While eccentricity is
  an important measure of vertex centrality, directly computing exact eccen
 tricity for all vertices on large-scale graphs is prohibitively costly. Ta
 kes and Kosters proposed an...\n
