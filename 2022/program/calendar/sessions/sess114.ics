DESCRIPTION:Cutting the Tail: Designing High Performance Message Brokers t
 o Reduce Tail Latencies in Stream Processing\n\nJaved, Lu, Panda\n\nOver t
 he last decade, organizations have become heavily reliant on providing nea
 r-instantaneous insights to the end user based on vast amounts of data col
 lected from various sources in real-time. To accomplish this task, a strea
 m processing pipeline is constructed which consists of a Stream Processi..
 .\n\n---------------------\nA Heterogeneity-Aware Task Scheduler for Spark
 \n\nXu, Butt, Lim, Kannan\n\nBig data processing systems such as Spark are
  employed in an increasing number of diverse applications such as machine 
 learning, graph computation, and scientific computing, each with dynamic a
 nd different resource needs. These applications increasingly run on hetero
 geneous hardware, e.g., with out-...\n\n---------------------\nDynamic Con
 trol of CPU Usage in a Lambda Platform\n\nKim, HoseinyFarahabady, Lee, Zom
 aya, Jurdak\n\nLambda platform is a new concept based on an event-driven s
 erver-less computation that empowers application developers to build scala
 ble enterprise software in a virtualized environment without provisioning 
 or managing any physical servers (a server-less solution).\nIn reality, ho
