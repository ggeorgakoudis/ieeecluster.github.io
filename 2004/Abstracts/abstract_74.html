<blockquote>
The interaction of simultaneously co-allocated jobs can often create contention in the network infrastructure of a dedicated computational grid. This contention can lead to degraded job run-time performance.  In this paper, we present several bandwidth-aware co-allocating meta-schedulers. These schedulers take into account inter-cluster network utilization as a means by which to mitigate this impact. We make use of a bandwidth-centric parallel job communication model that captures the time-varying utilization of shared inter-cluster network resources.  By doing so, we are able to evaluate the performance of grid scheduling algorithms that focus not only on node resource allocation, but also on shared inter-cluster network bandwidth.
