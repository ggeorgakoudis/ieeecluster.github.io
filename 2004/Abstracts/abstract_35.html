<blockquote>
The complexity and cost of isolating the root cause of system problems
in large parallel computers generally scales with the size of the
system. Syslog messages provide a primary source of system feedback,
but manual review is tedious and error prone. Informatic analysis can
be used to detect subtle anomalies in the syslog message stream,
thereby increasing the availability of the overall system. In this
paper I describe the novel use of the bioinformatic-inspired Teiresias
algorithm to automatically classify syslog messages, and compare it to
an existing log analysis tool (SLCT). I then describe the use of
occurrence statistics to group time-correlated messages, and present a
simple graphical user interface for viewing analysis results. Finally,
example analyses of syslogs from three independent clusters are
presented.
