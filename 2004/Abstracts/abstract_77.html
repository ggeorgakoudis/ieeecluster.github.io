<blockquote>
 In multicluster systems, and more generally, in grids, jobs may require co-allocation, i.e., the simultaneous allocation of  resources such as processors and input files in multiple clusters. While such jobs may have reduced runtimes because they  have access to more resources, waiting for processors in multiple clusters and for the input files to become available in  the right locations, may introduce inefficiencies. In previous work, we have studied through simulations only processor  co-allocation. Here, we extend this work with an analysis of the performance in a real testbed of our prototype Processor  and Data Co-Allocator with the Close-to-Files (CF) job-placement algorithm. CF tries to place job components on clusters  with enough idle processors which are close to the sites where the input files reside. We present a comparison of the  performance of CF and the Worst-Fit job-placement algorithm, with and without file replication, achieved with our prototype.  Our most important findings are that CF with replication works best, and that the utilization in our testbed can be driven  to about 80%
