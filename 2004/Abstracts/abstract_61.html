<blockquote>
A working Single System Image distributed Operating System is presented. Dubbed Kerrighed, it provides a unified approach and support to both the MPI and the Shared Memory programming models.  The system is operational in a 16-processor cluster at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires in Rennes, France.  In this paper, the system is described with emphasis on  its main contributing and distinguishing factors, namely its  DSM based on memory containers, its flexible handling of scheduling and checkpointing strategies, and its efficient and unified communications layer.   Because of the importance and popularity of data parallel  applications in these systems, we present a brief discussion  of the mapping of two well known and established data parallelalgorithms. It is shown that ShearSort is remarkably   well suited for the architecture/system pair as is the ever   so popular and important Two-Dimensional Fast Fourier  Transform.
