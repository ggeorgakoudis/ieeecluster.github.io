Abstract JuxtaView is a cluster-based application for viewing large imagery on scalable tiled displays. We present in JuxtaView, a new parallel computing and distributed memory approach for out-of-core montage visualization, using LambdaRAM, a software-based network level cache system. The final goal of JuxtaView is to enable a user to interactively roam through terabytes of distributed, geo-referenced data ranging from satellite imagery to aerial photography.  In working towards this goal, we describe our first prototype implemented over a local area network, where the image is distributed using LambdaRAM, on the memory of all nodes of a PC cluster driving a tiled display wall. Each node of the cluster controlling a tile of the display extracts a portion of the image to be displayed on the tile, fetching data as required from LambdaRAM’s distributed memory pool. Aggressive pre-fetching schemes employed by LambdaRAM helps to reduce latency involved in remote memory access. We compare our approach with traditional approaches for out-of-core visualization like memory mapped IO.
