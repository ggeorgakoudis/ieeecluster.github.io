Emerging infrastructure of computational grids composed of  Clusters-of-Clusters (CoC) interlinked through high  throughput channels promises unprecedented raw compute  power for terascale applications. Projects such as the NSF  Teragrid and EU Datagrid deploy CoCs across multiple  geographical sites providing tens of teraflops. Efficient  scaling of terascale applications on these grids poses a  challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of the resources  (Operating Systems and SANs) present at each site that  makes interoperability among multiple clusters difficult.  In addition, due to the enormous disparity in latency and  throughput of the channels within the SAN and those  interlinking multiple clusters, these CoC grids contain  deep communication hierarchies that prohibit efficient  scaling of tightly-coupled applications.  In this paper,  we present a design of a grid-enabled MPI called MPICH-VMI  for running terascale applications over CoC based  computational grids. MPICH-VMI is based on MPICH  implementation of MPI 1.1 standard and utilizes a  middleware messaging library called the Virtual Machine  Interface (VMI). VMI enables MPICH-VMI to communicate over  heterogeneous networks common in CoC based grid. MPICH-VMI  also features novel optimizations for hiding communication  hierarchies present in CoC based grids. We also present  some preliminary results with MPICH-VMI running on the  TeraGrid for MPI benchmarks and applications. Content-Disposition: form-data; name="PASSWORD"  biteme
