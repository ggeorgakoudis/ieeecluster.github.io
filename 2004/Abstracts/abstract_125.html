<blockquote>
Programmable Network Interface Cards (NICs) have been  leveraged to support efficient collective communication  and synchronization.  Previous studies have exploited  NIC programmability to support efficient barrier, broadcast   and reduce operations.  This paper explores the design of NIC-based allgather with different algorithms.  Along with  these algorithms, salient strategies have been utilized to provide scalable topology management, global  buffer management, efficient communication processing,  as well as flow control and reliability.  The resulting  allgather algorithms have been incorporated into a NIC-based   collective protocol over Myrinet/GM.  Compared to  the host-based allgather operation, over 16 nodes  the NIC-based allgather operations improves allgather  performance by a factor up to 3.01.  Furthermore,  the NIC-based allgather operations have better scalability  to large systems and very little host CPU utilization.   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first in the literature to report efficient NIC-based allgather algorithms over Myrinet/GM.
