<h3>Abstract</h3>
<blockquote>
We installed a PC Cluster as a main computing resource at RIKEN in 
March, 2004.  We achieved 8.7 TFLOPs on the system and it is ranked 7th 
in the world.  This system replaced a Fujitsu VPP700 vector/parallel 
computer which had provided variety of services to supercomputer users 
at RIKEN.  We designed the new system with two special points so that 
not only classical supercomputer users but also experimental data 
processing groups and bioinformatics users can utilize the system.  The 
system is a heterogeneous system which is composed of five PC clusters 
with different capabilities and includes relatively large main memory 
vector/parallel computer, NEC SX-7.  The other is in software side.  As 
the system should looks similar to the previous system, the front end 
system provides all services except for interactive jobs on a cluster or 
vector/parallel computer.  

I will describe this system in detail and talk how to achieve high score 
for LINPACK on this heterogeneous system with relatively slower network 
among the clusters.

<h3>Biography</h3>
Ryutaro HIMENO received the B.E. and the M.E. from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan in 1977 and 1979, respectively.  He received Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Tokyo in 1988.  In 1979, he joined Central Research Laboratories, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan, where he has been engaged in the research of applying Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis to the car aerodynamic development.  From 1984 to 1986, he served as a researcher at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Tokyo, Japan.  In 1998, he joined RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) and is Director of Advanced Center for Computing and Communication at RIKEN.  He is also a visiting Associate Professor at Saitama University.  He currently studies curve balls in baseball games and blood flows of human bodies.  
He was a winner of Nikkei Scientific Visualization Contest in 2000 and received JSME Computational Mechanics Division Award in 1997 and JSME Youth Engineer Award in 1988.  He was also awarded Paper Award by NICOGRAPH in 1993, Giga FLOPS Award by CRAY Research Inc. in 1990 and other awards.
