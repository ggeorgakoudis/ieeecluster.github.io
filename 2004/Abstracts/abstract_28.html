<blockquote>
Access to shared data is critical to the long term success of grids of distributed systems.  As more parallel  applications are being used on these grids, the need for  some kind of parallel I/O facility across distributed  systems increases.  However, grid middleware has thus far had only limited support for distributed parallel I/O.  In this paper, we present an implementation of the MPI-2  I/O interface using the Globus GridFTP client API.  MPI is  widely used for parallel computing, and its I/O interface  maps onto a large variety of storage systems.  The  limitations of using GridFTP as an MPI-I/O transport  mechanism are described, as well as support for parallel  access to scientific data formats such as HDF and NetCDF.  We  compare the performance of GridFTP to that of NFS on the same  network using several parallel I/O benchmarks.  Our tests  indicate that GridFTP can be a workable transport for  parallel I/O, particularly for distributed read-only access   to shared data sets.
