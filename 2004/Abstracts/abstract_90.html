The expanding processor-memory performance gap cause  several scientific applications spend a major part of  their execution time stalled in accessing memory. Loops  are the basic blocks, where most of these data accesses  take place. Memory performance improvement relies in  optimizing these loop accesses. Loop transformations (e.g.  loop unrolling, loop tiling) and array restructuring  optimizations improve this performance by increasing the  locality of memory accesses. However, to find the best  optimization parameters dynamically at runtime, we need a  fast and simple analytical model to predict the memory  access cost. Most of the existing models are complex and  impractical to be integrated in the automatic tuning  systems. In this paper, we propose a simple, fast and  reasonably accurate model that is capable of predicting  the memory access cost based on a wide range of data  access patterns. We classify the data access patterns that  appear in the nested loops of scientific applications. We  also discuss our applying this model in optimizing the  performance of derived datatypes in Message Passing  Interface (MPI) implementation.
