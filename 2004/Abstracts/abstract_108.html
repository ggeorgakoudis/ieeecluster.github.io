<blockquote>
We describe the use of component software in an area to which  this approach has not been classically applied, the area of   cluster system software.  By ``cluster system software,'' we  mean the collection of programs used in configuring and maintaining individual nodes, together with the software involved in submission, scheduling, monitoring, and termination of jobs.  We describe how the component approach maps onto the cluster systems software problem,  together with our experiences with the approach in  implementing an all-new suite of systems software for a medium-sized cluster with unusually complex systems software  requirements.
