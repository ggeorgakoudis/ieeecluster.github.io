Grid computing brings with it additional complexities and  unexpected failures. Just keeping track of our jobs traversing  different grid resources before completion can at times become  tricky. In this paper, we introduce a client-centric grid  knowledgebase that keeps track of the job performance and  failure characteristics on different grid resources as  observed by the client. We present the design and  implementation of our prototype grid knowledgebase and  evaluate its effectiveness on two real life grid data  processing pipelines: NCSA image processing pipeline and WCER video processing pipeline. It enabled us to easily extract   useful job and resource information and interpret them to make  better scheduling decisions. Using it, we were able to better   understand failures and were able to devise innovative methods   to automatically avoid and recover from failures and  dynamically adapt to grid environment improving  fault-tolerance and performance.
