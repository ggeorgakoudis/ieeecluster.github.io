<blockquote>
Cluster Storage Systems where storage devices are distributed  across a large number of nodes are able to reduce the I/O bottleneck problems present in most centralized storage systems. However, such distributed storage devices are hard to  manage efficiently. In this paper, we examine the use of explicit, component-based (command and data) paths between hosts and disks as a vehicle for performing non-disruptive storage system reconfiguration. We describe the mechanisms necessary to perform reconfigurations and show how they can be  used to handle two management tasks: migration between network  technologies and rebuilding a disk in a mirror. Our approach  is validated through initial performance measurements of these  two tasks using a prototype implementation.  The results show  that on-line reconfiguration is possible at a modest cost.
