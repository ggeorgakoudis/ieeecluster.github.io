--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In less than a decade, commodity clusters have become mainstream
and cost-effective computing platforms for executing a wide range of
computation-, data-, and transaction-oriented parallel applications. In
spite of countless deployed platforms and resounding application
successes, many research and development challenges remain for achieving
higher performance, scalability, and usability. The IEEE TFCC Cluster
2004 conference, to be held in beautiful San Diego, provides an open forum
for researchers, practitioners, and users to present and discuss issues,
directions, and results that will shape the future of cluster computing.

SCOPE
-----

   Cluster 2004 welcomes paper and poster submissions from engineers and
   scientists in academia and industry describing original research work in
   all areas of cluster computing. In addition, Cluster 2004 will welcome
   proposals for tutorials and workshops to be held concurrently with the
   conference. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   Cluster Middleware:
    - Single-System Image Services         - Software Environments and Tools
    - Standard Software for Clusters       - I/O Libraries, File Systems,
                                             and Distributed RAID

   Cluster Networking:
    - High-Speed System Interconnects      - Lightweight Communication Protocols
    - Fast Message Passing Libraries

   Cluster Management and Maintenance:
    - Cluster Security and Reliability     - Tools for Managing Clusters
    - Cluster Job and Resource Management  - High-Availability Cluster Solutions

   Applications:
    - Scientific and E-Commerce Apps       - Data 
Distribution and Load Balancing
    - Scheduling and Parallel Algorithms   - Innovative Cluster Applications
    - Tools and Environments

   Performance Analysis and Evaluation:
    - Benchmarking and Profiling Tools     - Performance Prediction and Modeling
    - Analysis and Visualization

   Grid Computing and Clusters:
    - Grid / Clusters Integration          - Network-Based Distributed Computing
    - Mobile Agents and Java for
      Clusters/Grids

TECHNICAL PAPERS
----------------

   Paper Format: Not to exceed 25 double-spaced, numbered pages (including
         title, author affiliations, abstract, keywords, figures, tables and
         bibliographical references) using 12 point font on 8.5x11-inch pages
         with 1-inch margins all around.

   Submission: An on-line submission page will be activated on the
         conference web site two weeks before the submission
         deadline. Authors should submit a PostScript (level 2) or PDF
         file. Hard copy submissions will not be accepted.

POSTERS
-------

    Augmenting direct submissions will be technical paper submissions that were
    not accepted but are recommended by the committee for poster presentation.
    (The latter of course requires authorization by the author(s).)

    Abstract Format: 1 page PDF including Title, Authors with their
         affiliations, and a 200 word, single-spaced abstract.

   Submission: via email to Richard Barrett (rbarrett@lanl.gov)

JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE
---------------------

   Authors of the best papers from the conference will be invited to submit an
   expanded version of their papers for possible publication in a special issue
   of the International Journal of High Performance Computing and Networking
   (IJHPCN), which will appear in 2005.
