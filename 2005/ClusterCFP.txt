--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In less than a decade, clusters of commodity PCs have become the most
 cost-effective computing platforms for executing a wide range of
 high performance applications from molecular biology simulations to
 search and indexing on the Internet.

 In spite of countless deployed platforms and resounding application
 successes, many research and development challenges remain for achieving
 better performance, scalability, and usability. The IEEE TCSC Cluster
 2005 conference provides an open forum for researchers, practitioners,
 and users to present and discuss issues, directions, and results
 that will shape the future of cluster computing.

 As cluster architecture is becoming a more mature field of
 application it remains particularly important to maintain an event
 that links the academic interests and new ideas to the experience
 reports of practitioners and application developers.

See the upcoming Call for Participation for more details.
