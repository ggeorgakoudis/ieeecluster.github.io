SUMMARY:Predicting Performance Using Collaborative Filtering
DESCRIPTION:Predicting Performance Using Collaborative Filtering\n\nSalari
 a, Drozd, Podobas...\n\n\nPerformance prediction of parallel applications 
 across systems becomes increasingly important in today's diverse computing
  environments. A wide range of choices in execution platforms pose new cha
 llenges to researchers in choosing a system which best fits their workload
 s and administrators in scheduling applications to the best performing sys
 tems. While previous studies have employed simulation- or profile-based pr
 ediction approaches, such solutions are time-consuming to be deployed on m
 ultiple platforms. To address this problem, we use two collaborative filte
 ring techniques to build analytical models which can quickly and accuratel
 y predict the performance of workloads across different multicore systems.
  The first technique leverages information gained from performance observe
 d for certain applications on a subset of systems and use it to discover s
 imilarities among applications as well as systems. The second collaborativ
 e filtering based model learns latent features of systems and workloads au
 tomatically and use these features to characterize the performance of appl
 ications on different platforms. We evaluated both the methods using 30 wo
 rkloads chosen from NAS Parallel Benchmarks, BOTS and Rodinia benchmarking
  suites on ten different systems. Our results show that such collaborative
  filtering methods can make predictions with RMSE as low as 0.6 and with a
 n average RMSE of 1.6.
