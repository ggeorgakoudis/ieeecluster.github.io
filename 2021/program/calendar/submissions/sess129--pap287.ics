SUMMARY:PDFE: Flexible Parallel State Machine Replication for Cloud Comput
 ing
DESCRIPTION:PDFE: Flexible Parallel State Machine Replication for Cloud Co
 mputing\n\nWu, Wu, Huang...\n\n\nState machine replication (SMR) is a fund
 amental fault tolerant technique for distributed systems to guarantee cons
 istency among replicas via sequential execution of commands. With the deve
 lopment of cloud computing, parallel SMR has been recently proposed for la
 rge scale cloud datacenters. In this paper, we propose PDFE, a novel paral
 lel SMR scheme, which realizes flexible dispatch of parallel ordered comma
 nds for parallel executing. In PDFE, the mapping/binding between ordering 
 threads and work threads becomes dynamic, and commands can be dis-patched 
 according to the work load level of different threads. Such flexibility ca
 n help achieve two levels of load balancing: load balancing between orderi
 ng threads and work threads, and load balancing among work threads. The ma
 jor challenge in our work lies in the inconsistency problem caused by dyna
 mic changes in command dispatch, and it is addressed by a specially design
 ed mechanism. Compared with existing parallel SMR schemes, PDFE can achiev
 e better load balancing and higher system efficiency. Such advantages are 
 validated by experimental perfor-mance evaluation.
